## What a Claude Code custom agent file's tools line really does (empty = every tool; none is refused), and what a subagent's transcript and sidecar carry — read back live 2026-09-17

Probed on develop-qzapp with throwaway agent files, dispatched from a
fresh headless session (an agent file is read at session start; one
written mid-session is "not found"): an empty `tools:` line or `tools: []`
inherits EVERY tool; a list that resolves to nothing (`tools: none`, an
unrecognised name such as `TodoWrite`) makes the harness refuse to spawn
the agent at all; `disallowedTools` still leaves Monitor, SendMessage,
Enter/ExitWorktree and the MCP tools. A subagent with exactly one inert
tool (`tools: TaskStop`, or `ExitWorktree`) does spawn and can read and
run nothing — that is the locale worker's shape
(`docs/live-checks/2026-09-17-language-culture-bridge.md`).

A subagent's transcript is `<slug>/<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`
beside a sidecar `agent-<id>.meta.json` whose `agentType` names the type
dispatched (`code-review`, `claude-code-guide`, …). Every transcript
carries the hand-back as a `tool_use` named `SubagentHandback` and an
injected English `<system-reminder>` user record, so "no tool_use block"
identifies nothing and every user record is not the dispatcher's input.

**Why:** the first cut of the language-culture worker said "no tools"
and the `workers` measure keyed on "no tool_use" — the blind review
called both unproven, and the probes showed both wrong.

**How to apply:** design a fenced subagent as "one inert tool", identify
subagent transcripts by the sidecar, strip the reminder spans, and probe
the harness from a fresh session before trusting a frontmatter field.
