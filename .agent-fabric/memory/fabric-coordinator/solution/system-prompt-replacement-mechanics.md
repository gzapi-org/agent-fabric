## What --system-prompt-file replaces and what the harness still injects (read back live 2026-09-17), and the identifier rule a translated prompt must keep

Read back live on Claude Code 2.1.274 and from its docs (2026-09-17):
`--system-prompt-file` replaces the harness's own instruction text and
the per-machine Memory section, and nothing else — the harness still
sends, outside the file and in English, its SDK opening line, the
function-calling grammar, every tool schema, the agent/skill listings,
MCP instructions, CLAUDE.md (a user-turn reminder) and the reminders.
There is no prepend and no settings key; `--append-system-prompt-file`
appends after the default. Tools are dispatched by `tool_use.name`
against the schemas, never by prose: a translated prompt is free in its
prose and must keep every identifier it quotes byte-identical (the
harness text's own list is `bin/fabric-locale tokens
runtime/claude-code/harness/en.md`). The harness text changes with the
build and no flag prints it: its capture is a live-check duty
(`docs/live-checks/2026-09-17-claude-code-harness-prompt.md`).

**Why:** the CEO wanted the ge holder launched with the whole prompt in
Georgian, charter first; the plan of 2026-09-17 built the machinery on
these facts (`docs/language-culture-bridge.md`, "The prompt in the
locale").

Measured 2026-09-18 as the ge holder, one-turn calls, total input:
the whole prompt replaced in Georgian 31 935 tokens; the old flow
(English harness + the fabric's part appended) 38 438; the bare
default 26 180 — the replacement costs less, and per-body estimates
differenced across cached prefixes overstate. `--disallowedTools` is
variadic: pass it last or it eats a positional prompt. `launch --print`
renders the state file as a side effect.

**How to apply:** never translate identifiers; probe a harness claim
from a fresh `claude -p` session before designing on it; a lagging
translation is served and named by lint, never a failed launch; the
locale carve-out (`policies/AUTHORITY.md`) is how a holder commits its
translations. See [[subagent-tools-and-transcripts]].
