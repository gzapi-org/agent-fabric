## Never `check | tail -1 && git commit`: the pipe's status is tail's, so a failed lint/static/suite still commits — run the check, capture rc=$?, commit only on 0

Twice on 2026-09-25 a check failed and the commit went ahead anyway:
`python3 tools/fabric/lint.py 2>&1 | tail -1 && … git commit` (PR #35 opened
with lint red: the hosts schema refused operator_key) and
`bash tests/static.sh 2>&1 | tail -1 && git add … && git commit` (a
`.pathname` module URL the static guard forbids). The pipe's exit status is
`tail`'s, always 0. [[cross-repo-lint-window]] already said "no pipe before
the commit &&"; it was not enough as a clause inside another memory.

A third time the same day, a different shape: `…; bash tests/static.sh | tail -1;
git add … && git status; git commit` — the check ran, printed FAILED, and the
`;` after it let the commit go (unpushed, amended). The rule is not "no pipe"
but "the commit is gated on the check's own status in the same command".

**How to apply:** `bash tests/static.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; rc=$?; [ $rc -eq 0 ] && git commit …`
— every commit command, even a "small" one after a multi-step edit
— or `set -o pipefail` in the same command. Show the output separately if
it is needed. A test suite's summary line is read, not trusted by `&&`.

Fourth time, 2026-09-26: `a; b; c && git commit --amend` ran the amend on
static's status while test_fabric-status had just failed (`;`, not `&&`).
Caught before push, and re-amended gated on `rc`. Put the commit under
`if [ $rc -eq 0 ]` on the one check that matters, never behind a list
of `;`-joined checks.
