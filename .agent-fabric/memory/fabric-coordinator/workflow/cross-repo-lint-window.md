## A fabric push that changes what a project's index must list reddens that project's queue until its index PR merges — hold the push for a quiet queue until fabric-ref is live; and never chain a commit behind a piped test run

Four times on 2026-09-18 a gzapp required check went red because
agent-fabric main moved under `_ban-checks.yml`'s unpinned checkout —
the last one (the language-culture brief, 695a75e) after I had written
the landing rule and said the window would be "minutes"; #855's queue
run landed inside those minutes. The CEO: "all time the same error …
did you learn?"

**Why:** the corpus lint reads two repositories at their heads, and the
order is forced (an index listing a slice not yet on fabric main is the
same finding), so sequencing shortens the window and never closes it;
only the pin closes it (`.agent-fabric/fabric-ref` + the project's
checkout step, gzapp#854/#857). Also: `python3 tests/x.py | tail &&
git commit` commits on tail's exit status — dc61f19 went to main with a
failing case that way.

**How to apply:** until the pin is live on a project's main, a fabric
push that changes what that project's index must list waits for an
empty merge queue and goes out with the index PR in the same minute;
with the pin live, the ref moves in the index PR and the push is free.
Never put a pipe between a test run and the `&&` that commits — run the
suite to a file and test its exit. Register a new `case_` in the
suite's `main()` list (test_lint.py collects by list, not by name).
