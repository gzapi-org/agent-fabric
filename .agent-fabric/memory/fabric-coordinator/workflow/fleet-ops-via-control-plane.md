## An operation on accounts (move Claude account, sync, verify, restart) goes through signed control-plane messages, never hostexec/sudo per login — build the action if it is missing

On 2026-09-25 I moved eleven logins to another Claude account and, because
the `secrets-sync` action was still unmerged, ran `fabric-secrets sync` and
a fingerprint check per login through `runtime/hostexec`. The owner: "this
process must be fully done by control plane via message."

**Why:** the control plane is the fabric's way to act on accounts: signed,
replayable-safe, answered per account with its own verdict. A hostexec loop
is the coordinator reaching into every login with sudo, and its checks are
the coordinator's, not the account's.

**How to apply:** when a fleet operation has no action yet, the missing
action is the work — add it (signed op, verification in the reply, exit 1
on any row not ok) rather than looping hostexec. hostexec stays the
fallback for a host whose daemons are down, and for distribution
([[distribute-after-merge]]). For account moves: `fabric-accounts assign`
sends `secrets-sync --expect <template sha12> --restart` (branch
develop-qzapp/user/account-assign, commit df4b53c).
