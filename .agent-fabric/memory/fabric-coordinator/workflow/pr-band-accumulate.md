## One open PR per agent (gzapp's rule, with its exceptions) and 8–16 work commits to arm — the next piece of work is another commit, never a PR per topic; two one-commit PRs in a morning was the mistake

ONE open pull request per agent (gzapp's CLAUDE.md, "When to open a
NEW PR, and when to keep committing" — now fabric-wide in team.md):
while a PR is open, the next piece of work is another commit on it if
the branch is addable, else it waits for the merge and is built
locally. Concerns are commit boundaries, not PR boundaries. Exceptions,
stated in the new PR's description: a finding on the queued PR itself;
urgency (user-visible or CI-blocking). The band — eight to sixteen work
commits arm at the review gate; fewer, ask the owner — is separate and
also stands.

**Why:** on 2026-09-19 I opened #19 (1 commit) and #20 (1 commit) from
one session in one morning; the owner: "again!!!! 2 and 1 commits! must
stay in the same pr". The fabric had only the band; gzapp had the
one-open-PR rule and I had not lifted it; my charter said "small,
reviewable pull requests". I then over-corrected to "no exceptions",
told architect-cto the gzapp rule was wrong, and had to withdraw it:
the owner — "1 with exception; architect-cto-01 was right". Reconciled
in team.md and the charter (PR #19).

**How to apply:** before `gh pr create`, count `git rev-list --count
origin/main..HEAD`; under eight, keep working on the branch. A second
topic goes on the same branch as its own commit. Fold a stray branch in
unrebased (`git merge --no-ff`) and close its PR naming where it went.
See [[blind-review-loop]] for the review that gates the arming.
