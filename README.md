# agent-fabric

The infrastructure through which people and agents build **enduring
organizations**: teams that learn from their work, keep their expertise
when their tools change, and take responsibility within a mandate the
humans set. Today it is the control plane for the Claude Code agents that
work on the repositories beside it — identities, roles, memory, model
routing, agent-to-agent communication, policy — and holds nothing about
what any project builds. What it is for, pillar by pillar, and how much
of each exists today: [ADR-000](docs/adr/ADR-000-the-enduring-organization.md).

## Five minutes: from an account to a working agent

A Linux host with `git`, `python3` (3.13 or newer), `node` (20 or newer)
and `gh`. One Linux account per agent. A parent directory, here
`~/projects/`, that holds this repository beside the project checkouts it
manages. Every step below runs as the agent's own login.

```sh
# 1. Set the account up, once.
cd ~/projects && git clone <this repository> agent-fabric
agent-fabric/runtime/claude-code/bootstrap.sh   # workspace instructions, hooks, agent files, every command on PATH
fabric-secrets sync                             # the account's own credentials, from the encrypted store its parent made

# 2. Bind a role, from a login shell.
fabric-role list
fabric-role bind backend-dev                    # the function this session will perform

# 3. Launch, from the working copy the work is in.
cd ~/projects/<project>                         # the directory is context; the login is the identity
../agent-fabric/runtime/openrouter/launch       # through OpenRouter; --provider anthropic for plain Claude
```

The session starts knowing who it is (`fabric-status`), what it owes
(`fabric-jobs list`) and which project rules apply, and it watches its
inbox from its first turn. Another agent reaches it by writing a message
file and running `gzcoord-send <file>`; the address is `<host>/<login>`.
What a session learns it writes to its own memory, one fact per file.
A session bound to `fabric-coordinator` turns that into shared
knowledge:

```sh
fabric-ctl all memory --out ~/drain             # every account harvests its own memory; nothing reads another home
tools/fabric/assemble.py --bundle ~/drain/<login>/<wc>.tar \
    --project <project> --working-copy ~/projects/<wc> --stamp $(date +%F)
```

A further agent on the host is one command for a coordinator:
`runtime/provisioning/new-agent.sh <login> <role> --claude-account <account> --project <id>`.

## The flow: bind, launch, inbox, drain

```text
 fabric-role bind <role>       a login shell; the function the next session will hold
          │
          ▼

          │                    model and an effort, starts Claude Code with the watch armed
          ▼

   ├─ work    branch → commit → PR      main is reached only through a pull request
   └─ learn   ~/.claude/…/memory/       one fact per file; a roles_class opts it into the drain
          │
          ▼
 drain (fabric-coordinator)    fabric-ctl all memory → tools/fabric/assemble.py
          │                    → <working copy>/.agent-fabric/memory/<role>/, with provenance
          ▼
 the next session              the SessionStart hook hands it the role's remit and INDEX.md;
                               a slice that disagrees with the tree loses to the tree
```

A role never changes inside a session: a different role is a rebind and
a relaunch. What may cross to another organization, and what never does,
is [ADR-035](docs/adr/ADR-035-federation-between-organizations.md).

## Decisions

What the fabric has decided, why, and what would reopen it lives in
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/README.md): numbered decision records, amended in
place with their history kept, checked by `tools/fabric/adr.py` in the
commit hook, in CI and in the suite. Look a subject up in
[`docs/adr/DIGEST.md`](docs/adr/DIGEST.md) with `fabric-adr lookup <topic>`,
then read the record.

- fabric-coordinator writes the records; only the owner accepts one, and
  an `Accepted` record names where the owner's word is.
- Another role that wants a decision changed proposes it to
  fabric-coordinator (a GZCoord `REQUEST`, or a pull request it does not
  merge).
- Outside this repository a record is cited as "agent-fabric ADR-NNN".

## What is kept apart

What must endure is kept apart from what must be able to change
([ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-role-login-and-model-are-kept-apart.md)).
Never collapse these: an agent keeps its name across roles, projects,
working copies, hosts and sessions; two agents in one working copy are
two agents; a role is held by any number of agents at once.

| dimension | the question | where the answer lives |
|---|---|---|
| **agent** | Which Linux user is this agent? | `runtime/identity.py` (the effective user, nothing else); `bin/fabric-whoami` |
| **role** | What function is it performing now? | `identities/roles/<role>/` (charter, brief, recall, skills), `identities/roles/catalog.json`; bound before launch from a login shell (`bin/fabric-role bind`), carried in the system prompt |
| **project** | Which logical system is it working on? | `projects/registry.json`, matched from a working copy's remote |
| **working copy** | Which checkout is in use? | the cwd's git toplevel: a label, not an identity |
| **host** | Which machine is the account on? | `runtime/hosts/registry.json`, reached through `runtime/hostexec/` and `bin/fabric-host` ([ADR-010](docs/adr/ADR-010-hosts-provisioning-host-execution-and-resources.md)) |
| **session** | Which conversation is this? | the harness session id, in the runtime binding ([ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-per-agent-state-is-one-layer.md)) |
| **capability and model** | How much reasoning does a task need, and which model serves it now? | `routing/capabilities.json` classes: `code-low`, `code-medium`, `code-high`, `code-plan`, `code-review`; layered per role and login by `routing/profiles.json`, with a routed effort in `routing/effort.json` ([ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005-models-are-routed-by-capability-class.md), [ADR-006](docs/adr/ADR-006-effort-is-routed.md)) |

## What an agent knows, and how far to trust it

An agent answers from five layers, and where two disagree the higher one
wins ([ADR-013](docs/adr/ADR-013-the-memory-model.md),
[ADR-037](docs/adr/ADR-037-each-agent-keeps-a-job-list.md),
[ADR-041](docs/adr/ADR-041-agent-local-episodic-history.md)):

Curated memory lives in the repositories; jobs and the episodic journal
live in each agent's own state, and no agent reads another's.

## What it is made of

| part | what it does | where | decided in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **memory** | knowledge by scope (the field, the system, the individual) and kind, written by whoever learnt it and drained with provenance | `memory/` here for the field and what roles share; `<working copy>/.agent-fabric/memory/<role>/` in each project for that system ([manual](memory/README.md)) | ADR-013, ADR-014 |
| **jobs** | each agent's own list of what it has undertaken, its state, and whether the next one needs a fresh session | `bin/fabric-jobs`, `bin/fabric-fresh`; in the agent's state | ADR-037, ADR-022 |
| **episodic history** | every GZCoord message the agent sent or received, kept before it is posted or acknowledged; read back with `fabric-history`, threads included | `tools/fabric/episodic.py`, `bin/fabric-history`; `episodic.db` in the agent's state | ADR-041 |
| **communication** | agents talk to each other over GZCOORD/1, an advisory protocol; the address is `<host>/<login>` | `communication/gzcoord/` | ADR-032, ADR-033 |
| **control plane** | a control agent per account answers signed actions over the relay, with no model session needed: status, presence, fleet upgrades, account moves | `runtime/control/`, `bin/fabric-ctl`, `bin/fabric-accounts` | ADR-009, ADR-029, ADR-030, ADR-031 |
| **routing** | a capability class resolves to a provider's model, a family shim where one is needed (`routing/shims.json`), and an effort level | `routing/`, `bin/fabric-model` | ADR-005, ADR-006, ADR-007 |
| **harness adapter** | the launcher, hooks, agent files and settings that turn all of the above into a Claude Code session, on plain Claude or through OpenRouter | `runtime/openrouter/launch`, `runtime/claude-code/` | ADR-008, ADR-022 |
| **project binding** | which roles, domains and path rules apply to each managed repository, and each role's remit there | `<working copy>/.agent-fabric/` in the project (`taxonomy.json`, `roles/`); the fabric's own under `.agent-fabric/` here | ADR-004, ADR-011 |
| **policy and guards** | who may change what, enforced by a commit hook, a CI check and a suite case | `policies/` | ADR-018, ADR-019, ADR-020 |
| **credentials** | each login's secrets in its own encrypted store, put where the tools read them; never in a file here or in a message | `bin/fabric-secrets` | ADR-038, ADR-039 |
| **hosts and resources** | provisioning an account, running a command on its host, one holder per shared host resource | `runtime/provisioning/`, `runtime/hostexec/`, `bin/fabric-lease` | ADR-010 |

## How a session starts

```sh
agent-fabric/bin/fabric-role bind <role>          # from a login shell, once per role change
agent-fabric/runtime/openrouter/launch            # through OpenRouter
agent-fabric/runtime/openrouter/launch --provider anthropic   # on plain Claude
```

The launcher reads the binding, renders the role's launch prompt
(identity, charter, brief, the team and memory sections), resolves every
capability class to a model and an effort for the chosen provider,
writes them into the agent files, and starts the session with its
message watch armed; the settings `runtime/claude-code/bootstrap.sh`
writes for the account start it in auto mode. `projects/CLAUDE.md`, written by
`runtime/claude-code/bootstrap.sh`, imports `agent-fabric/CLAUDE.md`;
the SessionStart hook records the working copy and project and returns
that project's remit for the role. Nothing inside a session changes its
role: a different role is a rebind and a relaunch. Every sibling
repository keeps its own `CLAUDE.md`; `projects/` is not a git
repository.

## Runtime state and credentials

Never in this repository. Per agent, under
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/agent-fabric/agents/<login>/`:
`binding.json` (role, project, working copy, session, host),
`role-history.jsonl`, `model-profile.local.json` (the agent's own model
choices; `bin/fabric-model`), the rendered `launch-prompt.md` and the job
list, every one written through `runtime/identity.py`; the episodic
journal `episodic.db`, a SQLite store written only by
`tools/fabric/episodic.py`; and two GZCoord logs, the send ledger
`gzcoord-sent.jsonl` and the append-only `journal-bypass.jsonl`, the
record of every crossing made without the journal (ADR-003, ADR-041). The journal is local: a
host lost is a journal lost, until a backup exists. An identity's secrets are in
its own encrypted store (ADR-038), and `fabric-secrets sync` puts
them where the tools read them.

## Commands

```sh
bin/fabric-status          # who this session is, its binding, API path, models, effort, routing health — one call
bin/fabric-whoami          # the agent name (== id -un)
bin/fabric-role            # bind, status, list (from a login shell)
bin/fabric-model list      # every model and effort choice per provider, with its source layer
bin/fabric-ctl all status  # the fleet, answered by each account's control agent (coordinator)
bin/fabric-review brief    # the facts of a change for a blind review
bin/fabric-lease <name> -- <cmd>   # one holder per host resource
```

## Provenance

Every distilled slice records who learned it (`agent`), where (`host`,
`working_copy`), what it applies to (`project`, the role, the class) and
when (`distilled_at`, the observation hashes). A slice from before the
login model carries an old `clone_id` label that nothing resolves any
more.

## Origin

This infrastructure began inside one managed repository and was
extracted with `git filter-repo` into a control plane of its own; before
it went public its history was rewritten so that no commit carries that
project's knowledge or names its internals. What the extraction record
explained, the decision records now state. `docs/live-checks/` holds
what was measured live here: the evidence the records cite.

## Tests

```sh
tests/run.sh            # static checks, python suites, GZCoord, bash suites and guards
tests/run.sh static     # bash -n over every script, shellcheck (errors), ruff (ruff.toml)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the static checks once and the whole
of `tests/run.sh` on Python 3.13 with Node 20 and on 3.14 with Node 22 —
the oldest interpreters the tools promise to run on, and the newest a
host ships — and the static, python and bash suites in a Fedora
and a Debian container that install the fabric's host contract from the
platform profile's own package map (`runtime/provisioning/platform/`),
so the map is proven by being used. Locally a missing shellcheck or ruff
is said, not passed over. A test run leaves nothing behind it did not
find ([ADR-021](docs/adr/ADR-021-a-test-run-leaves-nothing-it-did-not-find.md)).

## License

**Apache-2.0**, throughout (`LICENSE`; `REUSE.toml` assigns nothing else,
and `reuse lint` passes). A managed project's knowledge lives in the
project's own repository (`<working copy>/.agent-fabric/memory/`) under
that project's license and is never here; `projects/<id>/` holds a
project's binding and integration material, which is this repository's.
`projects/registry.json` records each project's own license as
information. `tools/fabric/lint.py` refuses a second license in
`REUSE.toml`, a project with no stated license, and any project
knowledge under `memory/projects/`.
