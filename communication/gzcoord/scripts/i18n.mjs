// The lines the GZCoord tools print, in the language of the login that
// reads them.
//
// A language-culture holder reasons in the locale it is named for, and
// the fabric removes every English it controls from that session
// (docs/language-culture-bridge.md). The inbox was the last piece named
// as residue there — "the inbox drain (the wire is English)" — and it is
// two things, not one: the MESSAGE is the wire and stays as its sender
// wrote it, while everything the inbox says AROUND it (the head line,
// the delivery title, the validator's diagnostics, the cut notice, every
// error) is the fabric's own text and is the reader's to have in its
// language. This module is that seam. The owner, 2026-09-21.
//
// The validator's diagnostics are keys like the rest, which puts the
// seam INSIDE gzmsg.mjs rather than at the inbox's edge: the same
// sentences are printed by send.mjs and the gzmsg CLI, and a refusal a
// holder reads when composing is that holder's line too. It also means
// paths.mjs exists — see there.
//
// The dictionaries are the house i18n standard: one flat key -> string
// JSON file per locale, named for the locale's BCP-47 tag, keys as
// dotted slugs, `{name}` interpolation, no empty values, and every
// active locale complete against the default. i18n/README.md states it,
// cites where the house keeps it, and says what the fabric's copy cannot
// keep and why.
//
//   communication/gzcoord/i18n/en-US.json                the default locale
//   identities/roles/<role>/locale/<suffix>/<tag>.json    an active locale
//
// A login reaches its dictionary the way the launcher reaches its
// prompt — by the LOGIN's suffix (language-culture-ge -> ge) under the
// role the session is bound to — and the suffix names its tag in that
// locale's locale.json. Absent, unreadable or incomplete: the default
// locale, which is ADR-024's own last fallback step, never invented text.
//
// What is NOT in the dictionary, deliberately: the message body, the
// metadata keys (FROM, TO, TO-ROLE, MESSAGE-ID), the type names and
// `broadcast`. Those are the wire's vocabulary — a reader matches them
// by name, across locales, and a translated one would name nothing.
