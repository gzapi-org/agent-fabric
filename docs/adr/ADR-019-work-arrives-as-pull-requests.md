# ADR-019 — Work arrives as pull requests: one open PR per agent and repository, 8 or more work commits to arm, the gate read before arming, no machine attribution, repository settings

**Date:** 2026-09-18
**Status:** Accepted
**Ratified:** owner, 2026-09-27, by arming agent-fabric #52 (ratification by merge, the owner's rule of 2026-09-27)
**Decision Makers:** the owner; drafted by fabric-coordinator
**Scope:** identities/prompt/team.md (the PR rules every session reads); fabric-pr gate, runtime/github/commit-class.sh, fabric-pr review-status; tools/fabric/guards/ban_generated_by_attribution.py and policies/githooks/commit-msg; .github/workflows/ci.yml; `fabric-repo-settings` and the GitHub-side settings of gzapi-org/agent-fabric
**Pillar:** P3

## 1. Context and Problem

Until 2026-09-18 the coordinator committed to agent-fabric's `main`
directly, and the note that recorded the repository's settings said so.
Every managed project already took its work as pull requests, gated by a
review and CI, and the fabric's own changes had begun to break those
projects' runs. A pull request is where a change becomes an artifact
others can check before it lands (ADR-000, P3: a conversation is not a
decision until it reaches an artifact).

Two failures shaped the rules around it. PRs were opened per topic — two
one-commit PRs from one session in one morning (2026-09-19) — so each
paid a full review and CI cycle and the owner's attention for a sliver of
work; and a PR's size was judged by eye. Separately, the harness injects
an instruction to add a `Co-authored-by:` trailer and a session URL, and
it re-arrives with every model change: two sessions, days apart, lost the
rule against it in two different shapes.

## 2. Decision

**Work arrives as pull requests.** Every change reaches `main` through a
pull request; on agent-fabric every change from #11 onward has been a
merged PR.

**One open pull request per agent and repository**. While an
agent has a PR open in a repository, its next piece of work there is
another commit on it, if the branch is still addable; otherwise it is built locally and waits for
the merge. Concerns are commit boundaries, not PR boundaries.

**A PR is armed by its work-commit count**: the
commits of work as opened, review fixes excluded. Eight or more arm once
the gate is met, without the owner's word, a security-boundary change
too; fewer ask the owner, who arms;
sixteen is the size to open a batch at, not a condition for arming it.

**The gate is read before arming.** `pr-gate.sh` gives each open PR one
verdict from its checks, its review, its threads and its merge state;
arming follows a `MERGEABLE` verdict and nothing else.

**No machine attribution, anywhere** — no `Co-authored-by:` or
`Claude-Session:` trailer, no session URL, no "Generated with" footer, in
a commit message or a PR description.

**The repository's GitHub settings are recorded here**, since they live
outside git, and `fabric-repo-settings` reapplies the
part it covers.

## 3. Alternatives Considered

- **Direct commits to `main` by the coordinator** (the earlier practice,
  §1).
  Rejected in practice: no review before landing, no CI before landing,
  and a fabric change reached every project's check unreviewed.
- **A PR per topic, or "small, reviewable pull requests"** (the
  coordinator's earlier charter wording). Rejected by the
  owner: each costs a review, a CI run and an arming; topics are commits.
- **No exceptions to one-open-PR.** Tried and withdrawn within a
  day: a finding on the queued PR itself and an urgent fix are
  real exceptions.
- **Counting all commits.** Rejected: review fixes would push a PR over
  the band for being reviewed; they are excluded by their `Kind:`
  declaration (`commit-class.sh`).
- **Reading the kind from the subject.** Replaced: a fix without
  the trailer read as work, a "findings" commit as a fix, and a
  conventional `fix:` names a project's bug fix, which is work; the
  author declares the kind instead, and the hook refuses forgetting it.
- **Trusting the harness settings alone for attribution.** Rejected: the
  setting reaches an account only through its last bootstrap (ADR-008),
  so the commit-time and CI guards stay.

## 4. Rationale

The band spends the owner's attention where it matters: a PR large enough
to be worth a review round is armed by the gate, a security-boundary
change and an oversized one included, and a small one is the owner's
call; sixteen keeps a batch reviewable as advice, not as a gate. One PR per
agent makes a session's in-flight work one artifact to review and one
place to look. Reading the gate's verdict before arming — rather than
chaining a merge after a check — makes the arming depend on the verdict,
not on a pipe's exit status.

## 5. Binding Rules

1. Every change reaches a repository's `main` through a pull request;
   the author opens it, and it lands only through the gate (rule 5).
   Except where a project's `arm.json` declares `direct` (A 2026-10-10):
   a holder of one of its `roles` commits straight to the default
   branch, and only a change to a file matching its `pr_paths` (the
   harness, what installs, builds or runs, CI, deployment, `.env*` and
   `.gitignore`, scripts and any file with the executable mode,
   secret-shaped names) arrives as a pull request under rules 2 to 6;
   styles, tokens, fonts, images, content and pages do not. A direct
   push is always a fast-forward. `policies/githooks/pre-push`
   refuses a direct push that breaks this; in a project without
   `direct` it does nothing. Declared today for brand-comms on
   blueteam.ee, gzapi.ge, gzapp.decks and gzapi.brand, where one agent
   writes copy a commit at a time and the band, the gate and the
   branch cost more than they catch.
2. One open pull request per agent and repository (A 2026-10-06): a
   branch in another repository is never addable to the open one. While
   one is open — unarmed, armed
   or queued — the next work is another commit on it while the branch is
   addable. A branch stops being addable when the next piece depends on
   something merged, the branch is queued or merged, it touches a slow or
   flaky surface that would hold the rest hostage, the urgency differs, or
   it holds sixteen work commits, the size a batch is opened at. Two exceptions, each stated in the new
   PR's description: a finding on the queued PR itself (prefer dequeuing
   and fixing on the same head), and a fix that must land now (a
   user-visible or CI-blocking defect).
3. Every commit declares its kind in a `Kind:` trailer: `work`, or
   `review-fix` with the `Answers: <labels or thread>` it answers. The
   `commit-msg` hook stamps `review-fix` on a commit that carries
   `Answers:` alone and `work` on a hand-committed revert, and refuses
   any other commit without the trailer; a merge declares nothing
   (A 2026-10-08). Work commits are counted by
   `runtime/github/commit-class.sh` from the declaration: a merge is a
   merge; `Kind: work` is work; `Kind: review-fix` is a fix, unless what
   it answers is another pull request's review, when it is this one's
   work, except a pull request folded into this one (closed unmerged,
   its head inside this range), whose review fixes are fixes here (pr-gate,
   the compliance check and the after-the-fact split in
   `tools/fabric/results.py` read a fold from the PR's head, the
   last through GitHub's compare API); a revert and the commit it reverts, both in the range, count in
   no column. The hook is the rule's only check until the branches opened
   before it have merged: a commit that reaches a branch without the
   hook is not refused in CI yet. A commit with no `Kind:` (made before
   the rule, or without the hook) is read as before: an `Answers:` trailer is a review fix; a
   subject that names a review and says it answers one is a fix;
   everything else is work.
4. Eight or more work commits: arm once the gate is met, without the
   owner's word, a security-boundary change and over sixteen too
   (A 2026-10-05). Under eight: ask the
   owner, who arms. Sixteen is the size a batch is opened at; a PR over
   it is armed on the gate all the same, and the count is advice for the
   next batch.
5. The gate is `fabric-pr gate`'s verdict for the PR, read
   before arming: `MERGEABLE` needs checks green, a review on the current
   head (`pr-review-status.sh`), no unresolved thread, no conflict, no
   draft and no unfolded supply. The verdict does not read the review's
   findings; the session also has no open P1 or P2 finding before it arms
   (`identities/prompt/team.md`). Arming is a separate command, run on a
   verdict read — never chained behind the gate's own run. An arming
   holds for the head it was made on: a push after it takes auto-merge
   off (`.github/workflows/disarm-on-push.yml`, which says so on the PR),
   and the new head is armed again only through the gate.
6. What arming is depends on the repository. agent-fabric's `main` is
   held by a ruleset (`tools/fabric/github-ruleset-main.json`): a pull
   request, CI's aggregate check `ci-ok` and signed commits are required,
   and deletion
   and force-pushes are refused. With auto-merge on, a PR there is armed
   with `gh pr merge --auto --merge`, which waits for green; every merge
   is made from the one GitHub account every session uses, and a PR that
   introduces a new direction is merged only on the owner's word (ADR-001
   §5 rule 2). A managed project with a merge queue is armed with its own
   `fabric-pr arm`.
7. No commit message or PR description carries `Co-authored-by:` or
   `Claude-Session:` as a trailer, a "Generated with Claude Code" footer or
   a session URL: `policies/githooks/commit-msg` refuses the message,
   `tools/fabric/guards/ban_generated_by_attribution.py` checks every commit a branch
   adds and the PR description in CI and in `tests/run.sh`.
8. agent-fabric's GitHub settings are the table in §6. A change to them
   is a change to this record, and `fabric-repo-settings`
   is changed with it.

## 6. Consequences

- **agent-fabric on GitHub, as read with `gh api`:**

  | setting | value |
  |---|---|
  | visibility, default branch | public, `main` |
  | description | "Control plane for the agents working on sibling repositories: identities, roles, memory, model routing, messaging." |
  | topics | agent-memory, agent-orchestration, ai-agents, claude-code, control-plane, developer-tools, llm-ops, multi-agent-systems |
  | features | issues, projects, wiki on; discussions off |
  | merge methods | merge commit (title `MERGE_MESSAGE`, message `PR_TITLE`), squash (`COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE`, `COMMIT_MESSAGES`), rebase — all allowed by the repository; a pull request into `main` merges by merge commit only (the ruleset's `allowed_merge_methods`) |
  | auto-merge | on (it waits for the ruleset's required checks) |
  | delete branch on merge, suggest updating branches | off |
  | web commit sign-off | not required |
  | ruleset on `main` | `tools/fabric/github-ruleset-main.json`: deletion and force-push refused; a pull request (merge commits only, no approval count); one CI check required, `ci-ok`, which fails unless `static` and every `guards-and-suites` and `platform-smoke` leg succeeded; signed commits required. No merge queue, no branch protection beside it |
  | Actions | enabled, all actions allowed, SHA pinning not required; default workflow permissions read, may not approve pull requests |
  | secrets, variables, environments, self-hosted runners | none |
  | code scanning | CodeQL default setup (actions, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python), weekly and on every PR |
  | secret scanning | on, with push protection, validity checks and non-provider patterns; AI detection off |
  | Dependabot security updates | off |
  | access | one collaborator, the owner; no teams, no webhooks |

  Everything the fabric's own CI runs is in the tree (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
  `tests/run.sh`, `policies/`); CodeQL's default setup and secret scanning
  are the GitHub-side exceptions, and `fabric-repo-settings` sets
  neither. The check names a PR reports are per matrix leg —
  `guards-and-suites (python, 3.13, 20)` and its siblings, `static`,
  `platform-smoke (…)`, cut by GitHub past a length — so the ruleset
  requires only `ci-ok`, the job that needs them all, and a leg renamed
  or added changes nothing there.
- Nothing on GitHub enforces rules 1, 2, 4 or 5 on agent-fabric; they are
  practice, read to every session in `team.md`, and visible in the history.
- A managed project's CI checks this public repository out without a
  credential, at the commit its `fabric-ref` pins (ADR-011).

## 7. Future Evolution

- The note this record replaces said agent-fabric's commits go to `main`
  directly and gave the description ending "GZCoord" and a required-check
  context `ci / guards-and-suites`; the first no longer holds (§1), the
  second was changed on GitHub, the third is not a name GitHub reports.
  `fabric-repo-settings` now writes the live description.

## 8. Decision Status

Accepted and in force: the attribution ban, pull requests only, the
band, one open PR per agent and repository. The settings note is now a
stub pointing here.

| Date | Amendment | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-04 | `main` is protected | §5 rule 6, §6: a ruleset requires a pull request, the CI checks and signed commits; auto-merge on, so arming waits for green |
| 2026-10-05 | Eight or more arm without the owner's word, over sixteen too | §1, §5 rule 4: the owner's rulings of 2026-10-05; sixteen is batch-size advice only |
| 2026-10-05 | One required check | §5 rule 6, §6, §7: the ruleset requires CI's aggregate job `ci-ok` alone, in place of eleven per-leg names; the topics join the settings |
| 2026-10-06 | One open pull request per agent and repository | title, §2, §5 rule 2, §8: the limit is per repository; a branch in another repository is never addable |
| 2026-10-08 | Every commit declares its kind | §5 rule 3, §7: a `Kind:` trailer (`work` or `review-fix`) the commit-msg hook requires; the count reads it before the subject |
| 2026-10-08 | A folded pull request's review fixes are fixes | §5 rule 3: a PR closed unmerged with its head inside this range was folded in; its review fixes count as fixes here, not as follow-up work |
| 2026-10-09 | results.py reads a folded PR's review fixes | §5 rule 3: the after-the-fact split reads a fold too; the PR description's interim naming of a folded PR's fixes is withdrawn |
| 2026-10-09 | A push after the arming takes auto-merge off | §5 rule 5: an arming holds for its head; `.github/workflows/disarm-on-push.yml` takes auto-merge off an arming older than a push and comments |
| 2026-10-10 | Brand repositories commit straight to main | §5 rule 1: a project's arm.json `direct` names the roles that push to the default branch and the `pr_paths` that still need a pull request; policies/githooks/pre-push enforces it |
