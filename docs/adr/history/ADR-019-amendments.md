# ADR-019 — amendments

The full notes; the ADR's body reads current and its Amendments table lists them.

### Amendment 2026-10-04 — `main` is protected

Rule 6 said agent-fabric had auto-merge off and no ruleset, so arming a
pull request meant merging it, and `gh pr merge --auto` merged at once
while CI was still running: the session's own discipline was the only
thing between a red build and `main`. An external review of the fabric
named that as the next hardening step, and the owner approved a minimal
ruleset modelled on gzapp's: a pull request, the CI checks and signed
commits required; deletion and force-pushes refused; merge commits
only; no approval count, since every session merges from one account;
no merge queue, so arming stays one command. Auto-merge is on, so
`gh pr merge --auto` now waits for green. The ruleset is committed as
`tools/fabric/github-ruleset-main.json` and applied by
`tools/fabric/github-repo-settings.sh`, which used to force auto-merge
off. The authority guards still decide who may merge; GitHub now
refuses what is not a green pull request.

### Amendment 2026-10-05 — One required check

The 2026-10-04 ruleset required eleven checks by the names GitHub reports,
one per CI matrix leg; two of them, the platform-smoke legs, are names
GitHub cuts past a length, and every leg's name carries its matrix values,
so a job renamed or a matrix argument changed would have blocked every
merge until the ruleset named it (the record's own §7 said so). CI now
has an aggregate job, `ci-ok`, which needs `static`, `guards-and-suites`
and `platform-smoke` and fails unless each of them succeeded; it runs even
when one failed or was cancelled, since a skipped required check reads as
passing. The ruleset requires `ci-ok` alone. The repository's topics,
set by hand when the icon was made, are written by
`tools/fabric/github-repo-settings.sh` with the rest of the settings.

### Amendment 2026-10-05 — Eight or more arm without the owner's word, over sixteen too

Rule 4 armed eight to sixteen work commits on the gate, asked the owner
under eight, and had a batch over sixteen split before it opened. The
owner ruled twice on 2026-10-05: their standing word ("over 8 commits a
pr can be armed without my authorization") covers a security-boundary
change too, and "over 16 commit don't require my authorization". So
eight or more arm on the gate alone, over sixteen included; under eight
still asks the owner; sixteen stays the size a batch is opened at, as
advice. `tools/fabric/github/arm.py` asks the owner's word on a
security-boundary change only under eight (devex-tooling's supply), and
`identities/prompt/team.md` says the same to every session.


### Amendment 2026-10-06 — One open pull request per agent and repository

rust-ui-dev-01, given gzapi-org/herdr beside InterWeave, asked whether a
herdr pull request waits behind an InterWeave one. It never did in
practice: a branch in another repository cannot take the next commit,
so it is never addable to the open one, and the coordinator had kept a
fabric PR and project PRs open together throughout. team.md said so in
agent-fabric #104; this record follows it, as the two moved together
when "sixteen work commits" replaced "the band's ceiling".


### Amendment 2026-10-08 — Every commit declares its kind

Rule 3 guessed a commit's kind: an `Answers:` trailer meant a review fix,
and without one the subject's words decided. Two sessions reported the
same PR counts wrong on 2026-10-08 — their review fixes lacked the
trailer and read as work, and commits named after the "findings" they
addressed read as fixes — and the owner, deciding whether to arm, found
the marking "not well defined". The conventional `fix:` prefix could not
serve: in gzapp it names a bug fix of the project, which is work. So the
author declares the kind in a `Kind:` trailer, `work` or `review-fix`
(with its `Answers:`), and the `commit-msg` hook every managed checkout
runs refuses a commit without it, stamping the two cases it can tell for
certain (an `Answers:` trailer, git's own revert message). The counter
reads the declaration first and the old reading only for a commit that
has none, so the history before the rule keeps its count. A review fix
that answers another pull request's review stays work in its own
pull request, as before (devex-tooling's classifier keeps the rule it
was written for). The CI half of the guard waits for the branches
opened before the rule: a refusing check now would turn each of them
red.


### Amendment 2026-10-08 — A folded pull request's review fixes are fixes

gateway#10 was folded into gateway#11 (the owner asked why the two were
separate) and #10's two review fixes counted as #11's work: the rule that
a fix answering another PR's review is follow-up work could not tell a
merged PR's follow-up from a fold. rust-services-dev measured it (8 work
read where 6 was right, at the arm-without-asking threshold). A PR closed
unmerged whose head lies inside this range was folded in; its review
fixes are fixes here. Once the counter reads it, it needs no convention in the description. The counter's half (commit_class) is devex-tooling's and was not yet built when the rule was recorded; review of #125 found the record ahead of it, and the rule now says so.

### Amendment 2026-10-09 — results.py reads a folded PR's review fixes

python-dev-01's #132 (merged 2026-10-09) made `tools/fabric/results.py` pass `commit_class.Folds` for each merged pull request, asking ancestry of GitHub's compare API since results reads every registered repository and not one clone (d64ca04f), and read `Answers:` from the trailer block as pr-gate does (62ab655b). Rule 3's interim clause — that results did not read a fold yet, so a PR's description named the folded PR and its fixes — is withdrawn; the three counters read a fold alike.

### Amendment 2026-10-09 — A push after the arming takes auto-merge off

On #134 (2026-10-09) the gate was met and the owner's word given, then a conflict with main was resolved by a merge that put new code on the head; auto-merge stayed on, so the unreviewed resolution would have merged once checks passed, and was disarmed by hand. GitHub keeps auto-merge across a push from anyone with write access. The owner approved the guard (2026-10-09, from the reading of "loops, graphs & harnesses": a check that runs instead of a rule that is remembered). The workflow reads the arming time when it runs and leaves an arming made at or after the push, which is an arming of the new head; tests/test_disarm_on_push.py runs the workflow's own script against a fake gh.

### Amendment 2026-10-10 — Brand repositories commit straight to main

The owner, 2026-10-10, after arming blueteam.ee#3 (3 work, 0 fix) by hand: "these repo from brand agent updates by likely a commit at time so don't make sense the rule of 8 commit, merge queue or even the branching". Asked which flow replaces it, the owner chose direct commits to main for content, with a pull request only for boundary files, over direct commits for everything (the harness and the npm manifests would lose their only check) and over keeping pull requests without the floor (the branch and review cost stay per change). Same rule a person alone on a marketing site would follow (the owner's trust philosophy: one policy for people and agents). None of the four repositories has branch protection, so GitHub already accepts the push; the fence is the pre-push hook every registered working copy runs through core.hooksPath. `pr_paths` is narrower than `boundary.paths`: page sources, content, styles, design tokens, images and fonts commit directly (the secret-shaped names are anchored words, so `tokens.css` and an `authority` record are not secret-shaped); scripts in any common language, the build and install configuration and every file with the executable mode go by pull request, as does any push that is not a fast-forward; the boundary still governs what a pull request needs to arm.
