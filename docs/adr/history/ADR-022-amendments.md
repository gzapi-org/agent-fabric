# ADR-022 — amendments

The full notes; the ADR's body reads current and its Amendments table lists them.

### Amendment 2026-09-28 — An agent ends its own job with a fresh session

The owner, to the fabric-coordinator session, after asking how the
control plane could force a /clear on a session: "what i wish is that at
the end of a task/job a agent can do this on himself", then "put in the
same open pr".

A slash command comes only from the person at the keyboard, so a model
cannot /clear itself. The session is the launcher's child, though, and
the launcher already relaunches after a restart marker (the fleet
upgrades of ADR-009), resuming the stopped conversation. `fabric-fresh`
writes that marker with `fresh` true and a note and stops its own
session; the launcher, on a fresh marker, relaunches with no `--resume`
and puts the note in the opening prompt. The finished conversation stays
on disk. The command is refused outside a launched session (nothing
would bring one back) and on uncommitted changes unless `--force` (a job
not yet at its artifact). When to use it is the agent's judgement,
stated in CLAUDE.md; the owner's two choices, a refusal rather than a
warning on uncommitted changes and guidance rather than a rule on every
job, were taken as the safer defaults.

### Amendment 2026-09-28 — Local branches are swept weekly

The owner gave the fabric-coordinator session a branch-hygiene prompt,
"a process that each agent should do periodically": orient, a plain
fetch, every local branch counted against origin/main, worktrees and
their changes, a report, then the deletion of what shows 0, re-checked,
local only. Asked when and how, the owner chose a weekly nudge only (not
a step at the end of every job) and "delete 0s alone, ask for the rest".

`fabric-branches` carries the procedure so it is not redone from prose:
the report deletes nothing; `--sweep` refuses uncommitted changes and a
failed fetch, deletes the branches at 0 and removes clean worktrees at
0, keeps and lists everything else with its commits and pull request,
and records the sweep per working copy. The session-start hook reads
that record and says when it is over seven days old, in keeping with a
pull-based fabric. A merged pull request whose commits still count
above 0 (squashed, or history rewritten) is reported, never deleted:
the count cannot prove it merged.

### Amendment 2026-09-28 — The next job decides whether the session continues

Rule 10 left the moment of a fresh session to the agent's judgement, and
its relaunch always reopened the launcher's own directory. The owner
asked for a restart when the next job is in another repository, or on a
subject that is basically different, and chose that the command decides
and the agent confirms. Rule 12 is that rule: `fabric-jobs next` compares
project, working copy and topic (a label the agent sets) and prints
`fabric-fresh --job <id>` on any difference; the launcher starts the new
session in the job's working copy, with the job in its opening prompt,
and refuses a working copy that is gone or dirty by starting where it
was. The job list itself is ADR-037.

### Amendment 2026-09-30 — The opening prompt names no command

The opening prompt stays in the claude process's argv for the whole
session, and it named `gzcoord-inbox --follow`. A session tidying
"stale" watchers with `pgrep -f 'gzcoord-inbox --follow' | xargs kill`
matched its own claude process and killed itself: architect-cto-01,
twice on 2026-09-29, which the owner first took for a failed restart.
The prompt now tells the session to arm the watch as the start hook's
NO INBOX WATCH line gives it (context, never argv), or as the
gzcoord-receive skill says where the context has none, and names no
command. `runtime/claude-code/hooks/self-kill-guard.py` refuses a kill
whose pattern matches the session's own command line; `fabric-fresh`,
which signals by pid, is unaffected.

### Amendment 2026-10-10 — The watch is a background command, not a Monitor

The watch ran as a Monitor on `gzcoord-inbox --follow`. The harness caps
a Monitor at 30 minutes, so every quiet session got an expiry notice
every half hour, which rang the Fleet Deck's sound and woke the agent to
re-arm: annoying and costly (the owner). The watch is now
`gzcoord-inbox --until-delivery` run as a background Bash command
(`run_in_background`, `timeout: 7200000`): it blocks quietly, exits on
the first delivery addressed to the session, and the harness wakes the
session once per delivery; the session reads the output and runs it
again. A quiet session is woken at most once per two hours, the Bash
timeout. A refused token ends it with exit 4 and a relay unreachable for
fifteen minutes with exit 5, the reason on stdout. `--follow` is
unchanged for other consumers, and the start hook recognises either under
the session. §2 and §5 rules 1, 2 and 6 name the new command; the
launcher's opening prompt says to run it again after each delivery.
