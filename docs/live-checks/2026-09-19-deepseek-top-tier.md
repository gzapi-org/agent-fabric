# 2026-09-19 — DeepSeek V4 Pro on the broker's top tier, read back

The owner's decision, in the coordinator's session: the broker path's
session model, `code-high`, `code-plan` and the review class move to
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813`; `code-low` and `code-medium` stay GLM.
The reason for the review class is the tier: the owner runs adversarial
local review and wants the reviewer on the strongest admissible broker
model. It is the same model the session, `code-high` and `code-plan`
ride, so the reviewer's independence is the blind brief and a fresh
context — a different family it is only from `code-low` and
`code-medium`. Admissibility
rests on `2026-09-14-deepseek.md`; this note is the read-back of the
routing change itself.

## Resolution

From the branch checkout, `tools/fabric/routing.resolve` per class:

```
code-low     z-ai/glm-5.3-flash@preset/glm2claude-shim
code-medium  z-ai/glm-5.2@preset/glm2claude-shim
code-high    deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813@preset/deepseek2claude-shim
code-plan    deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813@preset/deepseek2claude-shim
code-review  deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813@preset/deepseek2claude-shim
session      deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813@preset/deepseek2claude-shim  (defaults)
```

`runtime/openrouter/launch --print` as `user` agrees; the review class is
pinned in the agent file, never exported (the fable export is
`code-plan`'s — the same composite today, by coincidence of the column,
not by sharing).

## Served

Headless, `launch -p …`, session `86f4cbd3`: a two-step task (one shell
command, one line of answer, read nothing else). Three turns, the command
run, the count right, the answer written unprompted and naming the model
("6 files under routing/; I am deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813 (DeepSeek V4
Pro)"); `modelUsage` carries one key,
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813@preset/deepseek2claude-shim`; `is_error:
false`. The `/generation` read-backs of the 2026-09-14 check are the
per-request evidence; this run's purpose was to show the composite still
serves through the launcher as committed today.
The harness logs `unrecognized_model` for the non-Anthropic id, as it
does for every broker model.

## Two overrides removed

Both coordinator-side local layers that would have masked the default
were unset: `p2p-network-dev-01`'s session (GLM 5.3, set that morning
so the account could run GLM before this decision) and `user`'s (GLM
5.3, older). With the default now the top tier, neither is needed; an
account that wants another session model sets its own layer again.

## What it decides

`routing/profiles.json` defaults, `routing/capabilities.json` broker
column, `routing/policies/review-grade.json` (Pro admitted with the
decision recorded; v4-flash still refused). architect-cto informed: the
review model is its call by charter, and the owner's word is above it.
