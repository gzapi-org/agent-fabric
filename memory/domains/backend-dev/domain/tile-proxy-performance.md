## Zero-copy PipeWriter streaming beats buffered ReadAsByteArrayAsync for a proxy path

For a byte-forwarding proxy path, buffering the whole upstream response with `ReadAsByteArrayAsync` before writing it out puts every payload on the managed/Large Object Heap. Switching to writing directly into Kestrel's `PipeWriter` (`GetMemory`/`Advance` in ~8KB chunks, no intermediate array, no `ArrayPool` rental) measured at ~37KB of managed allocation per request regardless of payload size (tested up to 2MB tiles) — the allocation floor is the forwarding path itself, not the GC mode. Byte-count metrics must be accumulated from actual bytes written per streamed chunk, not read off `Content-Length`, which can be absent, wrong, or not reflect a truncated/aborted transfer.

## Server GC's per-core heap assumption is wrong for a service sharing a host with siblings

For a memory-constrained container running a single high-throughput, low-live-set .NET service (a proxy with no real state, a few hundred KB live heap), Workstation GC with `ConcurrentGarbageCollection=false` measured identical RSS to Server GC under load (109MB after 300×2MB requests on a 6-core dev machine) while avoiding Server GC's default of one heap and one GC thread per core — a design that assumes sole ownership of the host and is simply wrong when the container shares RAM with sibling services. `InvariantGlobalization=true` is safe specifically because the service does no localisation and all output is machine-readable RFC 9457 JSON; `TieredPGO=true` was pinned explicitly (not left as an implicit SDK default) to survive a future SDK default change on the platform's hottest request path.
