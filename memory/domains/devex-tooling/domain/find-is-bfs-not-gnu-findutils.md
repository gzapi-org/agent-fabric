## `find` on develop-qzapp is bfs, which rejects relative timestamps — and the error reads as "zero results" whenever stderr is discarded.

`find` on this host resolves to **`bfs`**, not GNU findutils. It accepts only
ISO-8601 timestamps:

    find DIR -newermt "1 day ago"      # bfs: error: Invalid timestamp.
    find DIR -newermt "2026-09-06"     # works

The trap is not the error, it is the shape of the failure. The usual
`2>/dev/null` on an exploratory `find | wc -l` turns the rejection into a
confident **`0`**, which reads as a real measurement. It produced a wrong
factual claim in a report this way (reported "0 files touched in 7 days" for a
directory being written that minute).

Rule: when a `find` count looks surprisingly like zero, re-run it without
`2>/dev/null` before believing it. Same class as
[[gpg-signing-needs-a-tty-this-shell-lacks]] — a tool failing in the direction
that looks like a valid answer.
