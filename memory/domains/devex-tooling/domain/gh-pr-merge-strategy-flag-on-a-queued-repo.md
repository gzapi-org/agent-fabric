## `gh pr merge --auto --merge` on gzapp prints what looks like a refusal, leaves autoMergeRequest null, yet DOES enqueue the PR.

`main` in gzapi-org/gzapp is merge-queue managed, so the queue owns the merge
strategy. Passing a strategy flag anyway:

    gh pr merge <n> --auto --merge
    ! The merge strategy for main is set by the merge queue

That single line reads as a refusal, and `autoMergeRequest` stays **null**
afterwards — so the usual "verify it armed" check reports NOT ARMED. Both
signals point at failure. **The PR is nevertheless enqueued**: a follow-up
`gh pr merge <n> --auto` answers `already queued to merge`, and the GraphQL
`mergeQueueEntry` shows a real entry.

So `autoMergeRequest: null` does not mean "nothing will merge this" on a
queue-managed repo — auto-merge and a direct queue entry are two different
landing paths. Confirm with:

    gh api graphql -f query='query{repository(owner:"gzapi-org",name:"gzapp"){
      pullRequest(number:N){mergeQueueEntry{state position}}}}'

Also: `AWAITING_CHECKS` for many minutes is normal, not a stall — the
merge_group run takes ~12 minutes here. Compare against the run's COMPLETION
time, not its creation time, before diagnosing a stuck queue.

Belongs in the `pr-lifecycle` skill eventually; recorded here because the
session that found it could not commit.

**Burned again 2026-09-18 (#881):** I told backend-dev-01 their green PR was
"not armed" from `gh pr view --json autoMergeRequest,mergeStateStatus`
(null + CLEAN). It had been in the queue for 12 minutes — a queued PR reads
exactly like an unarmed one on those two fields. **Never assert "unarmed"
from `autoMergeRequest`**: run `tools/gh/pr-gate.sh <n>` (it reads
`mergeQueueEntry` and prints `queue=<pos>`), or query `mergeQueueEntry`
directly. `arm.sh`'s post-arm check reads `autoMergeRequest` too and would
fail on an instantly-queued PR — it must read the queue entry as well.
