## ubuntu-latest (24.04) blocks `unshare -r` via AppArmor; one sysctl lifts it, and a dummy link inside the netns needs no modprobe — measured 2026-09-25

On GitHub's hosted ubuntu-latest (24.04, kernel 6.17.0-azure, measured
2026-09-25 for InterWeave's mdns_bounds tests, commit 86faa715 there):

- `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` is 1, and `unshare -rn`
  fails with "write failed /proc/self/uid_map: Operation not permitted".
- `sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0` is the
  whole fix; no AppArmor profile change is needed.
- `ip link add X type dummy` inside `unshare -rn` works WITHOUT
  `modprobe dummy`, although lsmod does not list it. My assumption that
  module autoload is refused from a user namespace was wrong there.

**How to apply:** to verify a CI change on a runner before any PR exists,
push a throwaway branch carrying a workflow with
`on: push: branches: [<that branch>]` (push events use the workflow file
at the pushed commit), print the before-state as a control, then delete
the branch. Two such runs cost about 5 minutes.
