## in a Nominatim gazetteer the settlement ancestor is rank_address 16, never admin_level, and isaddress must order rather than filter

Reading a place's settlement out of Nominatim's `place_addressline`:

**`admin_level` does not name the settlement.** In [redacted] level 6 is the
*city* for a self-governing city (ქუთაისი) and the *municipality* for an
ordinary one (წყალტუბოს მუნიციპალიტეტი). A rule keyed on it labels a
village street with its municipality. **`rank_address` does name it**:
16 = the settlement whatever carries it (`place|city`, `place|village`, a
level-6 boundary or a level-8 one), 12 = municipality, 20 = district,
24 = neighbourhood, 26 = street.

**A settlement is commonly in `placex` twice and UNLINKED** — a `place`
row and an admin boundary, `linked_place_id` null on both, so following
the link cannot unify them. Nominatim marks exactly one of the pair
`isaddress`, and **which one flips from street to street**.

**So `isaddress` must ORDER, never filter.** Requiring it hid the city
from 321 [redacted] streets. Ignoring it moved 207 rows onto a *different*
locality, 130 onto a village flagged `isaddress=false` — because outside
the duplicate-representation case the several rank-16 lines of one street
are several **different villages**, and the flag is the only thing saying
which one the street is in. Order by `rank_address DESC, isaddress DESC,
(class='place') DESC`: the flagged ancestor wins when there is one, the
unflagged one is taken only when nothing else is on offer.

**A settlement with no rank-16 ancestor is its own locality.** Otherwise
it becomes a suburb of nothing. Promote only `place|city/town/village/
hamlet/locality` — never a neighbourhood or quarter.
