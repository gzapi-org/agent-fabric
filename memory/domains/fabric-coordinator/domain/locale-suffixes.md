## The fabric's locale suffixes: ge is Georgian (language-culture-ge, script Georgian), ru Russian; German would be de — never read ge as German

`identities/roles/language-culture/locale/ge/` is the **Georgian**
locale, held by `language-culture-ge` (the product's Georgian brand
string is გზაპი; its notes are in Georgian script). `ru` is Russian.
A German locale, if one is ever added, is `de`. The suffixes are the
holders' own choice and do not follow ISO 639-1 for Georgian (which
would be `ka`).

**Why:** the owner corrected "georgian not german; german is de" on
2026-09-19 — the suffix invites the wrong reading.

**How to apply:** write "the ge (Georgian) holder" the first time a
message or note names the locale; never expand `ge` to German.
