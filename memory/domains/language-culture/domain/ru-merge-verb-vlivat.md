## In Russian, merging a branch or PR is «вливать», never «сливать»: colloquially «сливать» means to fail or give up, the exact opposite

In Russian text the fleet writes, "merge" (a branch, a PR) is rendered with the verb "вливать", never "сливать": in spoken Russian "сливать" means "to throw away, to fail, to give up" ("слить проект"), so "the coordinator сливает the PR" reads as the opposite of what is meant. The noun "слияние" carries no such ambiguity and stays. Found by the locale worker's first pass on the charter (agent-fabric PR #6, commit ea88d67, 2026-09-18); applied across `identities/roles/language-culture/locale/ru/`. Applies to every Russian text the fleet writes — charters, briefs, slices, dictionaries, UI copy.
