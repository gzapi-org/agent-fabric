#
# `.agent-fabric/` in a repository is written by the fabric-coordinator
# ROLE. It holds the project's distilled knowledge (`memory/<role>/`,
# written by the drain) and nothing another role may edit by hand: a
# `backend-dev` session that changes a slice is asserting something about
# the system with no evidence behind it, outside the role that owns the
# corpus. This fails when a commit that changes `.agent-fabric/` does not
# declare that role.
#
# THE ROLE, NOT THE LOGIN. Which account committed is irrelevant; what
# matters is whether the session had the role BOUND when it committed.
# That binding is machine-local (runtime/identity.py), and the one place
# it can be checked for real is the keyboard: policies/githooks/pre-commit
# refuses the commit unless the binding holds the role, and commit-msg
# then writes what it verified into the message as a trailer:
#
#     Fabric-Role: fabric-coordinator
#
# This check reads that trailer on every commit the branch adds that
# touches `.agent-fabric/**`. In CI it is a TRIPWIRE: the trailer is
# text anyone can type, so it stops the accident — a session that never
# bound the role and never ran the hooks — and makes a deliberate change
# visible in review; it does not stop a session that means to route
# around it. The same limit check_charter_authority.sh states for the
# branch name. Merge commits are not examined (they carry no change of
# their own).
#
# RUNS IN ANY REPOSITORY. In agent-fabric ITSELF — recognised by
# policies/authority.json at the toplevel — EVERY commit the branch adds
# must declare the role: the control plane is read-only for every other
# role (CLAUDE.md, policies/AUTHORITY.md). In a managed project only the
# commits touching `.agent-fabric/**` must. The role name comes from
# policies/authority.json when this repository has one, else from
# $AGENT_FABRIC_ROOT/policies/authority.json, else it is
# fabric-coordinator.
#
# guards: .agent-fabric/**
# guards: ** (in agent-fabric itself)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  nothing under .agent-fabric/ changed, or every such commit declares
#      the role, or no base ref is resolvable (not a violation)
#   1  a commit changed .agent-fabric/ without declaring the role
#   2  invocation problem (cannot reach the repo root)

agent-fabric is read-only for every role but $owner_role — except a
locale's translations, identities/roles/<role>/locale/<suffix>/, which
the holder of <role> commits declaring its own role; in a managed
project, .agent-fabric/ (the project's distilled knowledge) is. A commit
there is made with that role bound (bin/fabric-role bind $owner_role,
from a login shell, then a relaunch) and the
agent-fabric git hooks installed (bootstrap.sh sets core.hooksPath): the
pre-commit hook checks the binding, the commit-msg hook records it as
the Fabric-Role trailer this check reads. The login that committed is
irrelevant. If a slice is wrong, raise it with $owner_role — a
correction enters through a drain with provenance, never as a hand edit.
