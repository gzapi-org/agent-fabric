# A role's DEFINITION is fabric-coordinator's to change: `identities/roles/*/
# charter.md`, the catalogue `identities/roles/catalog.json`, the
# per-project binding rules `projects/*/taxonomy.json`, the routing policy
# `routing/policies/*` and `policies/authority.json` itself. This fails
# when one of those changes on a branch that is not a fabric-coordinator
# branch.
#
# AUTHORITY BELONGS TO THE ROLE, NOT TO THE ACCOUNT. The branch's second
# segment names the agent (Linux login) that opened it. The check asks
# whether that agent is a recognised holder of fabric-coordinator: named
# in policies/authority.json, or named FOR the role by the provisioning
# convention (fabric-coordinator, fabric-coordinator-02). An account
# currently HOLDING some other role does not thereby own that role's
# definition — that is exactly the widening this tripwire exists to catch.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every distilled slice is generated -- the
# assembler writes it and lint.py rejects a hand-edit -- so a role's scope
# cannot drift by accident. `charter` and `recall` are the two classes
# lint.py exempts from `derived_from`, precisely because they are authored
# rather than distilled. That exemption is what makes charter.md the one
# place a session can quietly widen its own remit, and it lints clean:
# lint checks PROVENANCE, and this is a question of AUTHORITY.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated plainly so nobody mistakes it for a fence.
# Every session pushes as the same GitHub account, so there is no identity
# to check -- CODEOWNERS cannot tell one session from another here. All
# that is available is the branch name, which is self-declared. This is a
# TRIPWIRE: it stops the accident and the absent-minded edit, and it makes
# a deliberate change visible in review. A session that means to route
# around it can, by naming its branch differently, and nothing available
# in this repository would catch that.
#
# It also only enforces where a head branch is knowable. On a `merge_group`
# run the ref is the queue's synthetic branch, so the check reports and
# passes -- the `pull_request` run is where it bites, and that run is
# required before anything is queued.

`identities/roles/*/charter.md`, the role catalogue, a project's
taxonomy, the routing policies and policies/authority.json say what a
role is and is not, where it applies, and who may change that. They are
fabric-coordinator's to change (policies/AUTHORITY.md) -- a role does not
redefine itself, and holding a role is not owning its definition.

Propose it instead: open a PR touching only the definition, say what the
role is being asked to take on or give up, and leave it for
fabric-coordinator. Do not self-approve on the grounds that you are the
only session that understands the surface; that is the argument this
exists to refuse.
