# Built on a throwaway git repository, because the guard's whole input is
# a COMMITTED diff against a base ref. The first version of this test
# modified the working tree and asserted the guard fired; it did not, and
# could not — `git diff BASE...HEAD` never sees an uncommitted change. A
# positive control is the only reason that was caught.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions passed
#   1  one or more assertions failed
