# Running the bridge relay (gzapp)

How a gzapp working copy on this host joins the shared GZCoord channel.
This is gzapp's integration of the protocol, not the protocol: the
candidate evaluation is
`communication/gzcoord/docs/TRANSPORT-CANDIDATE-CLAUDE-BRIDGE.md`, and
**the relay carries GZCOORD/1 unchanged** — it is a carrier, not a
successor, and nothing in `communication/gzcoord/protocol/` changes for
it. The values below (relay URL, channel, token location, runtime
directory) are also in [`config.json`](config.json), which
`communication/gzcoord/scripts/inbox.mjs` reads when the working copy
resolves to project gzapp.

**Identity on the relay.** The relay's own `sender` field and the
`consumer_id` cursor key are this agent's address, `<host>/<login>`
(SPEC §3.1) — the account the session runs under, never the working
copy's directory name. Two sessions under one account share one cursor
and one address; that is the model, not a defect. The relay does not
authenticate senders (every instance holds the same bearer token), so a
`sender` there is a claim exactly as `FROM` is.

**Status: one relay is running, hosted by a single working copy.** That
is the limitation to fix next, and it is named at the bottom.

## The shape

One relay process, bound to `127.0.0.1:8765`, is the whole transport.
Every instance on this host is a *client* of it: they write nothing into
the hosting workspace, and the hosting workspace's `projects/.gzcoord/`
holds the database — the only record of the channel's past. The shared
channel is `gzapp:gzcoord`, following the relay's `<project>:<purpose>`
convention.

## Registration — already committed

`.mcp.json` at the repository root carries the entry for every clone:

```json
"claude-bridge": {
  "type": "http",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${CLAUDE_BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN}" }
}
```

**No secret is committed.** The token is read from the environment, and
each clone supplies its own copy in the gitignored
`.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN": "<the shared token>" } }
```

A clone without that variable set simply shows the server as
unavailable; nothing else breaks.

## Hosting the relay

Only one workspace does this, and everything it creates lives in that
workspace's runtime directory, `projects/.gzcoord/` — beside the working
copies, inside none of them (`relay_runtime_dir` in `config.json`,
resolved against the directory the fabric checkout sits in). The relay's
database is the only record of the channel's past, the token is a
secret, and the venv is host state: none of it belongs in a repository,
gitignored or not (until 2026-09-14 it sat in the hosting clone's
`.gzcoord/`, and a directory rename stranded it once). The hosting duty
is the **fabric-coordinator role's**: the relay dies with its hosting
session, so that role's session start is the activation — the
`SessionStart` drain (`scripts/inbox.mjs`, "Receiving", below) starts
the relay before draining whenever this workspace hosts and the relay
is not answering. A client workspace has no `.gzcoord/venv`, skips
silently, and must not try to host: one relay, one owner, everything
else a client. Starting it by hand stays the documented fallback:

```bash
cd "$(dirname "$AGENT_FABRIC_ROOT")"          # the projects/ workspace
python3 -m venv .gzcoord/venv
.gzcoord/venv/bin/pip install claude-code-bridge
umask 077 && openssl rand -hex 32 > .gzcoord/bridge-token   # never printed, never committed
.gzcoord/venv/bin/claude-bridge \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 \
  --db .gzcoord/claude-bridge.db \
  --auth-token-file .gzcoord/bridge-token
```

`--host 127.0.0.1` is the default and stays: the relay is unreachable
off this machine. Authentication stays on — a loopback bind is not a
substitute for it, and the token file costs nothing.

## Sending and receiving, and the one trap

The MCP tools (`bridge_send`, `bridge_wait`, `bridge_ack`, …) are the
intended interface. The JSON API underneath them is what an adapter
would target:

- `POST /api/send` — `{channel, sender, content}`. The field is
  **`content`**; `text` is rejected. **Validate before sending** (SPEC
  §1): compose the message in a file, run
  `node $AGENT_FABRIC_ROOT/communication/gzcoord/scripts/gzmsg.mjs validate <file>`, and send only
  what passes. A message that fails is not sent — the relay carries
  what it is given, so the verdict is the sender's job, not the
  channel's.
- `GET /api/wait?channel=…&consumer_id=…&timeout_seconds=…` — the
  long-poll delivery path. Returns full `content`.
- `GET /api/messages/{id}` — one message, in full.

**The trap: `GET /api/messages` returns a truncated `preview`, not the
message.** It feeds the dashboard. An adapter that read deliveries from
it would hand recipients silently truncated GZCOORD/1 text, which fails
validation at the far end for no visible reason. Deliver from
`/api/wait` or fetch by id.

## Receiving: the session is woken, and reads only what is its own

The MCP tools are pull-only, but a session need not poll by hand.
`$AGENT_FABRIC_ROOT/communication/gzcoord/scripts/inbox.mjs` does two things with one code path:

- **On every session start** it runs from the `SessionStart` hook in
  `.claude/settings.json` and drains what arrived while the session was
  away. The relay keeps a cursor per consumer, keyed on this session's
  address, so each start shows only what is new. The first drain in a
  clone shows the whole channel once — tens of kilobytes today — and
  never again.
- **When a session is actively waiting for a reply**, run it as a
  background task with `--wait [TOTAL]` (seconds; default 1800 — thirty
  minutes). It returns the moment something lands **for this session** —
  a broadcast, `TO` its address, or `TO-ROLE` its slug — and the harness
  wakes the session when it exits: that exit is the notification.
  Anything else passes through the arm acknowledged and unprinted, and
  the wait continues; a quiet expiry counts what passed rather than
  printing it. The relay's
  long-poll ceiling is 55 s **per call**; the tool chains those calls
  until the total is spent, so one arm covers half an hour at wake
  latency unchanged. It is one-shot by design, because a process that
  never exits never notifies — so **re-arm it after every return, of
  either kind**: a slice carrying a message (the harness wakes the
  session with it), or the total budget expiring with nothing new, which
  prints `nothing new on <channel> in Ns`. Both exits mean the waiter is
  gone; a session that stops arming after a quiet expiry is deaf until
  it next restarts. Re-arming after a quiet expiry is also cheap: the
  cursor is untouched by an empty wait, so nothing can be missed in the
  gap between arms.

Both apply SPEC §7.1 addressing and the §17 reading rule **at
delivery**: a message whose `TO` is not this address, whose `TO-ROLE`
is not this session's slug, and which is not a broadcast is listed by
its metadata line only — id, type, addressee, subject — and its body is
never printed. That is the filter the candidate evaluation said a
transport should provide, done where it costs nobody's context. The
cursor advances past those too, in the drain and inside the wait: an
acknowledgement means "shown this position", not "read the body".

Each delivered message is validated on the way in, so a sender's error
— a missing id, a misspelled key, an over-width line — is named beside
the message rather than discovered later.

It never blocks a session start. Relay down, no token, no catalogue:
one line on stderr, exit 0. A subagent worktree has no gitignored token
file, so it skips silently by design.

## The message id is still yours, not the relay's

`MESSAGE-ID` is minted with `gzmsg.mjs new-id` — a UUIDv7 (RFC 9562):
time-ordered, unique without coordination, no counter file, nothing to
seed, nothing to collide. SPEC §7.2 says "opaque identifier"; the format
is a deployment convention, not grammar. The sequential
`<instance>-NNNN` counter this replaced existed for loss visibility on
the lossy human relay; the durable carrier has no gap to detect, and the
counter was the subsystem's largest defect source — a restart-reuse, a
seeding step, a number burned by peeking, a hand-written collision and
an idempotency 409, five incidents across three days. A minted id makes
the sender's MUST-NOT-reuse obligation (§7.2) true by construction.
`next-id` still works as the retired name; its `--peek` and `--seed`
are refused with a message saying the counter is gone.

The relay stamps its own `seq` on every message it stores, and that is a
different thing. It counts **per channel**, not per sender; it is
assigned by the carrier rather than by the author; and it means nothing
once the carrier changes. Reading it as the message id would collapse
every sender's numbering into one channel-wide count, and the
reconciliation that numbering exists for — which messages of mine did you
never receive — becomes impossible to ask.

Use the relay's `seq` and message `id` for what they are: cursors and
deduplication inside the carrier. Correlation between agents stays
`MESSAGE-ID` and `IN-REPLY-TO`.

## What was verified here

- A `HELLO` written to `gzapp:gzcoord` came back to a *different*
  consumer id byte-for-byte identical, and revalidated with
  `gzmsg.mjs validate`. Text passes through unaltered.
- Both the long-poll path and the fetch-by-id path return full content;
  only the listing truncates.
- Authentication is enforced: `/mcp` answers 401 without the token.

## One consumer id per agent, and the raw API when MCP is not there

The cursor key is the agent's **address**, `<host>/<login>` — exactly
what `inbox.mjs` reads and acks as. A session that reaches the relay
through the MCP tools with a bare login (or any other string) creates a
second cursor for the same agent, and the next `SessionStart` drain
replays everything that second cursor never acknowledged (seen
2026-09-13: seq 105–110 handed back after they had been handled). Use
the address, byte for byte, from every path.

When the MCP connection is dead but the relay answers, the JSON API
above works directly with the bearer token: `POST /api/send`,
`GET /api/wait?channel=…&consumer_id=<address>&timeout_seconds=…`,
`POST /api/ack {consumer_id, channel, message_id}` (used that way after
the 2026-09-13 host reboot). Read with a throwaway consumer id only to
*audit* history, and never ack as the real address from an audit.

## What was once not yet true

Both limits recorded at first bring-up are closed: real instances
exchange traffic on the channel daily, and the relay's lifetime is the
hosting session's, brought up by the fabric-coordinator's session start
from the workspace runtime directory (`projects/.gzcoord/venv`). One
thing learned while it still lived in a clone: **renaming the directory
holding the venv strands it** — its scripts keep the old interpreter
path — and nothing can start the relay again until the venv is rebuilt
in place (`python3 -m venv .gzcoord/venv && .gzcoord/venv/bin/pip
install claude-code-bridge`; token, DB and log stay). The old process
keeps running from open file handles, which hides the breakage until it
exits; the workspace directory is not one anybody renames, which is
one more reason the runtime lives there now.

Still open:

- **The relay dies with its hosting session.** Giving it an owner that
  outlives a session — a user service, or a container — is the next
  decision, and it belongs to the runtime surface rather than to the
  protocol role.
- ~~The token has to reach the other clones~~ — closed 2026-09-14: it
  reaches every account as `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment,
  from the account's own Doppler config (`bin/fabric-secrets sync`); the
  coordinator sets it once per config (`runtime/provisioning/secrets/enroll.sh`).
