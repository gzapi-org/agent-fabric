# Claude Code PreToolUse hook for the Agent tool: the dispatch guard.
#
# Reads the tool call on stdin, prints a hookSpecificOutput JSON object
# to deny or ask, or prints nothing to allow. The rules it enforces are
# CLAUDE.md "Subagent dispatch"; the incidents behind each one are in
# the subagent-dispatch skill. This file exists so the program can be
# READ and TESTED (.claude/test_agent-dispatch-guard.sh) -- it used to
# be a one-line jq string inside settings.json, which nothing exercised.
#
# TWO CLASSES OF DISPATCH, decided in this order:
#
#   fork            -> allowed; a fork continues the session.
#   REVIEW class    -> subagent_type "code-review" AND description
#                      beginning "review" / "re-review" (any word
#                      form: Reviewing, Re-review of ...) AND model
#                      "fable" AND NO isolation. All four, or denied --
#                      never asked. Standing authorisation for the
#                      class: a review's failure mode is not a retry,
#                      it is a green PR that merges, so no per-dispatch
#                      prompt and no dropping to a cheaper tier because
#                      a review looks small. No worktree, because a
#                      review writes nothing and worktree.baseRef=head
#                      would hide uncommitted work from the one agent
#                      that must see it; the tree is read-only for it.
#                      WHY fable and not opus: the Agent tool's model
#                      field accepts only the tier aliases, and on the
#                      broker path one alias carries one exported
#                      model. code-high rides opus, so a reviewer on
#                      opus IS code-high's model -- on 2026-09-13 that
#                      was GLM 5.3. fable is the alias nothing else
#                      rides; the launcher exports the review-grade
#                      model under it and gates exactly that export.
#   CODING class   -> subagent_type code-low / code-medium / code-high:
#                      the class DECIDES the tier. `model` must be the
#                      alias runtime/claude-code/aliases.json binds to
#                      that class (haiku / sonnet / opus); anything
#                      else is denied, unset included. A class whose
#                      alias could be overridden per call is decorative:
#                      code-high on sonnet is "high" work on the cheap
#                      tier with nothing to say so. The alias stays on
#                      the call rather than being inferred, because it
#                      is what the harness resolves and what the broker
#                      launcher exports per session; the class is the
#                      vocabulary, the alias its binding, and the two
#                      must agree. code-high asks (premium).
#   READ-ONLY types -> Explore, Plan, claude-code-guide: no writing
#                      tool in their definition, and the clone guard
#                      (subagent-clone-guard.sh) fences their Bash in
#                      the session clone. Model required (the tier is
#                      still a choice); isolation NOT required — a
#                      worktree at baseRef=head would hide the
#                      uncommitted work a search or a plan is asked
#                      about, as it would for a review. Found
#                      2026-09-16: every Explore dispatch was denied
#                      and the research was done by hand.
#   locale-worker   -> the language-culture role's worker: a one-inert-tool
#                      subagent whose system prompt and every input are
#                      the locale's language, so its reasoning cannot
#                      start from English it never saw (the CEO,
#                      2026-09-17; docs/language-culture-bridge.md).
#                      Model required; isolation must be ABSENT (it
#                      writes nothing, a worktree protects nothing);
#                      any alias allowed and never asked — language
#                      judgement is premium by design. The dispatcher's
#                      role is not checked here (no branch checks it):
#                      the agent file exists only on a language-culture
#                      login (install-agent-files.sh), and an unknown
#                      type fails in the harness before this hook runs.
#   everything else -> model required; isolation "worktree" required;
#                      opus/fable ask (per-dispatch authorisation).
#
# WHY the description prefix is a condition and not a substitute for
# the type: a hook that granted the exemption on review-ish WORDS would
# be satisfiable by phrasing. Here the words can only NARROW -- the type
# is a file in the repo, and the prefix stops a writing dispatch
# ("Address review feedback") from wearing the review type and running
# unisolated in the clone. Another project learned exactly that the
# hard way: a guard that matched "review" anywhere let it through.
#
# WHY the model condition sits inside the review branch: keyed on the
# type alone, a sonnet or haiku dispatch would take the exemption and
# evade the rule beside it. Both halves, or neither.

# THE FILE PIN. Under a fabric launch (runtime/openrouter/launch, either
# provider) the review class runs on the model routing resolves for it —
# but not through the fable export: code-plan rides fable too, and one
# alias carries one export, so through it the reviewer would follow
# code-plan (as it once followed code-high on opus, 2026-09-13). Verified
# live 2026-09-15 on plain claude: the Agent tool's `model` accepts only
# the four aliases (a hook rewriting it to a model id is rejected at
# schema validation), the dispatch's `model` outranks the agent file's,
# and an agent file whose frontmatter names a model id runs on it when
# the dispatch leaves `model` unset. So the pin lives in the reviewer's
# agent file (install-agent-files.sh writes it there at launch, for the
# launch's provider, merged for this login — `pins --me`), and this
# guard — AFTER the review rules have held, `model: fable` included —
# allows the dispatch with `model` removed, so the file's pin applies.
# The file is checked against the same resolution first: another launch
# of this account on the other provider rewrites it, and a reviewer on a
# model nothing chose for this session is denied, not run. Only under a
# fabric launch; anywhere else the alias reaches the harness as written.
