# Claude Code PostModelSwitch hook: when the harness switched the model
# on its own — a safeguard flagged the last request and the session fell
# back to another model — tell the session, at once, what that means.
#
# The docs (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks, model-config, read 2026-09-16):
# PreModelSwitch is NOT run for a switch the harness makes itself; only
# PostModelSwitch is, with source "auto", requested_model null, and the
# switch is sticky — the session continues on the fallback model until
# /model. A PostModelSwitch hook cannot block; what it prints reaches the
# model with the next request. That is the channel this hook uses.
#
# WHY. The flagged text is contagious: a finding that tripped this
# session's safeguards trips every session it is sent to, and a
# broadcast lands in all of them at once. So the session is told, before
# it writes anything else, that nothing from that exchange goes into a
# GZCoord message, a commit, a PR body or a memory: from now on it
# filters out of everything it sends anything that could be read as the
# flagged category (a cybersecurity issue, most often), naming where a
# finding is and what class of problem it is, never its content — and
# that it now runs on a tier it was not launched with. A marker under the login's home lets send.mjs repeat the
# reminder on stderr at the moment of sending, and bin/fabric-status say
# the session fell back. The marker is per session (harness pid,
# CLAUDE_PID) like the plan-hold marker, and swept the same way.
#
# Silent on every switch the session asked for itself (source command,
# picker, sdk) and on a resume (the model restored is the one it had).
# Exit 0 always; nothing on stdout unless there is context to add.
