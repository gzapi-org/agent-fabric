#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Claude Code hook (PreToolUse on every tool, UserPromptSubmit, SessionEnd):
# hold this account's GZCoord inbox while a session is planning.
#
# A plan is written from the context the session has when it enters plan
# mode; a delivery landing in the middle of it is new context the plan
# was not asked to absorb. The harness gives no way to pause
# notifications, but the whole delivery path is ours: a message becomes a
# notification only because the watch (communication/gzcoord/scripts/
# inbox.mjs --follow) polls the relay and prints it. So the session says
# "planning" through a marker, and the watch does not poll while a
# marker is live: nothing is consumed, the relay keeps the cursor, and
# the first poll after the plan is approved delivers everything at once.
#
# One marker per SESSION: $HOME/.cache/agent-fabric/hold/<pid>.json,
# naming the harness pid (CLAUDE_PID, exported to hooks; the hook's
# parent IS that process, verified on 2.1.273), its start time from
# /proc, and the session id. The account is held while ANY marker names
# a live harness of this login — two sessions planning under one login
# hold together and release separately (the first review found a single
# file per login released the sibling's hold). Under $HOME, not /tmp:
# another login could pre-create a per-uid name under /tmp and own the
# directory, and then hold or release this login's inbox (the same
# review, P1); the home is the login's. The directory must be ours, mode
# 700 and not a symlink, or the hook writes nothing.
#
# Every hook event carries permission_mode (verified live 2.1.273:
# UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse; SessionStart does not), so the marker
# follows the mode rather than the EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode calls — a
# rejected plan stays in plan mode, and a plan entered by launch flag
# never calls EnterPlanMode. A subagent's event (agent_id present) is not
# the session's mode and is ignored. SessionEnd clears the session's own
# marker; every event sweeps markers whose harness is gone (dead pid, or
# a pid reused by a process with another start time).
#
# Exit 0 always, nothing on stdout: a hook that cannot run must not turn
# a planning session into a broken one. Without jq the marker is never
# written and the inbox behaves as before this hook existed.
