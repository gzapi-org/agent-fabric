"""runtime/claude-code/hooks/session-start.py — the SessionStart hook.

Reads the hook payload (cwd, session_id) on stdin, resolves the agent and
its context through runtime/identity.py, records the working copy,
project and session in the agent's runtime binding — never the role,
which only bin/fabric-role changes, from a login shell — and returns the
PROJECT LAYER of the session's context as hook output:

    {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "SessionStart",
                            "additionalContext": "agent-fabric: agent=… role=… project=… \n<the remit>\n<the INDEX pointer>"}}

The role layer (charter, brief, team and memory sections) is in the
system prompt the launcher rendered (tools/fabric/launch_prompt.py) and
never here. What goes here is what follows the working copy: the
project's remit for the role (<working copy>/.agent-fabric/roles/<role>.md
— what the function covers in THIS repository) and one line pointing at
the role's INDEX.md there. The hook runs at start, on resume and after a
compaction, so this layer is re-given each time from the cwd of the
moment — a session that moved to another working copy gets that
project's remit — and the drift line (a rebind under a running session)
is said at each of them. Read back live 2026-09-15: the JSON form is
taken (docs/live-checks/2026-09-15-append-system-prompt.md §6).

The agent name is whatever the OS says. The payload's cwd only tells us
which working copy and project the session is in; a session started in
the parent projects/ directory has neither and says so.

Never blocks a session start: any failure is one line on stderr and exit 0.
