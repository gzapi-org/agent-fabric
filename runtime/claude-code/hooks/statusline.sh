# The AGENT is the Linux login, from agent-fabric's canonical resolver
# (bin/fabric-whoami); the directory is shown as the working copy the
# session is in — context, never identity. Reads the session JSON on
# stdin; runs locally, no API tokens. Wired by the workspace
# .claude/settings.json `statusLine` that runtime/claude-code/bootstrap.sh
# writes.

# THE HARNESS BRACKET (owner, 2026-09-24): the Claude Code version (the
# bare number — the owner asked for no product name before it), the
# model and the session's live effort level, in that order — the three
# things that decide how this session thinks, readable at a glance and
# comparable across sessions (a session that reads "high" beside another's
# "medium" is a routing question; routing/effort.json says what each class
# asks for). Both are read from the session JSON, never from the
# environment: `version` is the harness's own; `effort` is optional in
# that JSON — present only when the model takes an effort level — so a
# model that expresses none shows NO level rather than an invented one,
# and an older harness that sends no version shows the model alone.
