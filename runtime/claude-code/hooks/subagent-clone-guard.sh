#
# Claude Code PreToolUse hook on Write / Edit / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit /
# Bash: a capability-class subagent running in the SESSION CLONE is
# read-only.
#
# WHY. Where a subagent runs is what tells a writer from a reader. Every
# writing dispatch carries isolation worktree and works under
# .claude/worktrees/ — the dispatch guard (agent-dispatch-guard.sh)
# refuses one that does not — and the one class that runs unisolated in
# the clone is the review class, whose agent file lists no writing tool
# and fences its Bash (review-bash-guard.sh). That leaves the dispatches
# the dispatch guard never sees: an agent() call inside a Workflow script
# (its tool input is script text, and both fields default the wrong
# way — isolation to the clone), and a launch that resolves a class
# natively rather than through the Agent tool. This hook is the
# backstop at the point of the write: a class subagent whose cwd is not
# under .claude/worktrees/ may not write, and its Bash gets the review
# fence (no state-changing git, no installs, no shell escapes, no
# redirection into the tree). For the review class it duplicates what
# the agent file already says; for everything else it is the only fence.
#
# SCOPE, deliberately narrow: only when the hook input carries an
# agent_id (a subagent — the main session is never touched) AND the
# agent_type is one this control plane dispatches (the three classes,
# the reviewer, and the harness built-ins a class-less call would have
# named). A fork continues the session and may write in the clone by
# design; an unknown type is left alone rather than guessed at.
#
# Verified on Claude Code 2.1.270: a subagent's tool call carries
# agent_id, agent_type and cwd in the hook input, and a worktree-isolated
# subagent reports <repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<id> as cwd. Whether a
# Workflow-spawned agent carries the same fields has not been observed
# live; the hook allows when they are absent, so it fails open there,
# not closed.
#
# Output: a deny decision, an ask when the guard itself cannot run, or
# nothing. Exit 0 always — exit 2 would block; a guard that cannot parse
# its input allows and says nothing.
