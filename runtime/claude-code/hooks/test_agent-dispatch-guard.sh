#
# What this holds still: the DECISION TABLE of the Agent dispatch hook.
# The program used to live as a jq string inside settings.json and its
# two properties were "pipe-tested at the time it was written" -- in a
# terminal, once, by hand. Both halves of the review carve-out were
# later found to be load-bearing TOGETHER (a type-only key let fable
# through), which is the kind of regression a table of cases catches
# and a comment does not.
#
# Every case pipes a tool-call payload through the REAL script and
# checks the decision: "allow" (no output), "deny", or "ask".
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions passed
#   1  one or more assertions failed
