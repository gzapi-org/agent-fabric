# Behavioural tests for subagent-clone-guard.sh.
#
# What this holds still: a capability-class subagent whose cwd is the
# session clone (not a worktree) may not write and gets the review Bash
# fence; the main session, a fork, an unknown type and an isolated
# subagent are untouched; a guard that cannot run asks rather than
# allows. Every case pipes a hook payload through the REAL script and
# checks the decision.
#
# Exit codes: 0 all assertions passed; 1 one or more failed
