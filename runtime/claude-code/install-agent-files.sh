#
# The launcher calls this for its provider before every exec; bootstrap.sh
# at provisioning (anthropic, the unlaunched default); bin/fabric-model
# after a change to the review pin. The pin it applies is per agent and
# per provider: `routing.py pins --me --provider P` merges the column with
# the login's role and its model-profile.local.json.
#
# WHY A FILE CARRIES THE PIN. The review class rides the same tier alias
# as code-plan (fable): the Agent tool's `model` takes only the four
# aliases, and one alias carries one export, so through the export the
# reviewer would follow code-plan (as it once followed code-high on opus,
# 2026-09-13). The one route left (verified live on plain claude,
# 2026-09-15): the agent file's `model:` line decides when the dispatch
# leaves `model` unset, and the dispatch guard drops the dispatch's alias
# under a fabric launch after checking it was `fable`. The coding classes
# ride the exported aliases and keep the repo file's alias line; the pin
# here is the review class's alone, from routing, so there is one source.
# One file serves one launch at a time: two sessions of one account on
# different providers would rewrite it in turn, which the guard catches.

# ONE LAUNCH OF AN ACCOUNT AT A TIME, now for every class. Before effort,
# only code-review.md differed between providers, and agent-dispatch-guard.sh
# catches that one by comparing its `model:` with the launch's resolution.
# Effort is written into ALL five files per provider, so an openrouter
# launch leaves GLM's clamp in code-medium.md and an anthropic session
# dispatching afterwards runs at a level nothing chose for it — and no
# guard compares that. Extending the guard per dispatched class is the
# real fix and is deliberately NOT done here: it means buffering the hook's
# stdin so the class's file can be read before jq sees the call, and a
# half-made change to that fence is worse than a documented constraint
# (review of 2026-09-23, F7). Until then: run one launch of an account at a
# time, or re-run `bin/fabric-model apply` from the session you are in.
#
# The agent file is the ONLY per-class channel for effort: the Agent tool
# takes no effort on a dispatch (2.1.280, read back), and the environment
# variable would reach every subagent at once and flatten the per-class
# decision. So the level routing resolves for each class is written into
# its frontmatter here, exactly as the review class's model is.
# A class whose model expresses no effort gets NO line — absent is not the
# same as a default, and writing one would claim a decision nobody made.
