"""runtime/claude-code/user-settings.py — the fabric's keys in a login's
Claude Code user settings, written by bootstrap.sh on every account.

    user-settings.py <settings.json> [--dry-run]
    user-settings.py --help | -h

Any other argument that begins with "-" is refused (exit 2), never taken
for the path.

User scope reaches every session of the login whatever directory it is
launched from, so this is where a setting the fabric wants on every
agent goes. Every other key is kept as read. Prints one line in the
installer's shape (`+` written, `=` already current, `!` refused) and
exits 0; 1 when the file is unreadable, 2 on a usage error.

The keys, and why each is here:

`attribution` {commit "", pr "", sessionUrl false}. Claude Code builds
an attribution reminder from this key and injects it as a system
reminder on the first turn and again after every model switch, outside
any launch prompt — a `--system-prompt-file` does not remove it (read
back on 2.1.276, docs/live-checks/2026-09-18-attribution-reminder-off.md).
With no key set the reminder asks for a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer and a
"Generated with" footer, which policies/ban_generated_by_attribution.sh
refuses after the fact. An empty string hides each (the harness's own
schema: "Empty string hides attribution"), and with both hidden the
harness sends the opposite reminder — do not add attribution lines.
`sessionUrl` false drops the `Claude-Session:` trailer a web or Remote
Control session would add. The guard stays as the fence. The deprecated
`includeCoAuthoredBy` said the same thing; the key replaces it.

`env.DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` "1": the fleet's Claude Code version is the one
runtime/claude-code/harness.json pins, moved by `fabric-ctl … upgrade
claude` and nothing else. `autoUpdates: false` in ~/.claude.json is NOT
that switch on a native install: the harness honours it only when
`autoUpdatesProtectedForNative` is not true (2.1.282, read from its
binary), and the coordinator's account, native and protected, installed
2.1.282 on its own on 2026-09-24. DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER is checked first,
unconditionally; it stops background updates only — `claude install <v>`,
which the upgrade uses, still works (DISABLE_UPDATES would stop that too).
Every other `env` key is kept as read.

`showThinkingSummaries` true and `verbose` true (the owner, 2026-09-20):
an agent's session is read by the person operating the fleet, not only
by the agent — the thinking summaries and the full tool output are what
lets a stalled or misdirected session be seen for what it is from its
terminal, rather than reconstructed afterwards from a transcript.

`tui` "default": the session draws in the terminal's normal screen, so
the terminal keeps its scrollback and its scrollbar works. Without the
key the harness uses its full-screen renderer on the alternate screen,
which leaves nothing to scroll back through: the coordinator's account,
set by hand with `/tui default`, scrolled; every other account did not.
The person operating the fleet reads a session's history in its
terminal, for the same reason as the two keys above.

`hooks.UserPromptSubmit` freshness.py (the owner, 2026-10-07): on each
prompt, a background `git fetch` of the session's working copy when its
last fetch is over ten minutes old, and one line to the model when the
checkout lacks commits of origin's default branch, said once per change.

`statusLine`: the fabric's status line (hooks/statusline.sh: harness
version, model, effort, agent@host, pull request, working copy, branch),
at user scope so it shows wherever a session starts. The workspace's
.claude/settings.json carries it too, but a session started inside a
working copy reads that project's settings, not the workspace's, and
two new agents launched in a clone had none (the owner, 2026-10-07).
The fabric's always: a status line of another command is replaced.

`permissions.allow`: `Bash(<name> *)` for every command in
runtime/claude-code/commands.json — the fabric's own commands, which
bootstrap links into ~/.local/bin (the owner, 2026-09-26: no approval
for any fabric script or executable). A narrow rule, one command name
each — never one in its `not_allowed`, a wrapper that runs another
command — because in auto mode a narrow Bash rule is resolved before the
classifier while a broad one, or one naming Monitor, is set aside; a
Monitor follows the Bash rules. Every other rule the account allows,
denies or asks is kept as read, and an `ask` rule still wins.

`permissions.defaultMode` "auto" (the owner, 2026-09-26): every agent's
session starts in auto mode. Eight accounts provisioned by hand had no
mode and started in the default one, asking for what the classifier
would allow; the allow rules above assume auto.

`autoMode` (the owner, 2026-10-01): what the auto-mode classifier is told
about the fleet, from policies/auto-mode.json. A login's own wizard
(/auto-mode-setup) saw one project's transcripts and proposed a picture
true of that project alone — that project private, so confidential
material "is fine to push", on a login that also pushes to agent-fabric,
which is public. The classifier reads `autoMode` from user and managed settings
only, never a project's .claude/ (the harness's own docs), so user scope
is where the fleet's picture goes. `environment` is Claude Code's own
list (`claude auto-mode defaults`, from the pinned harness) with each
slot the policy names replaced: a "$defaults" plus the fleet's entries
would leave the built-in "Organization: None configured" beside the
fleet's own. When the defaults cannot be read, an existing `autoMode` is
kept as it is and the line says so. `allow`, `soft_deny` and `hard_deny`
are "$defaults" plus the policy's. `skillOverrides.auto-mode-setup`
"off": the wizard would write a login's own `autoMode` over the fleet's.
