"""runtime/claude-code/user-settings.py — the fabric's keys in a login's
Claude Code user settings, written by bootstrap.sh on every account.

    user-settings.py <settings.json> [--dry-run]
    user-settings.py --help | -h

Any other argument that begins with "-" is refused (exit 2), never taken
for the path.

User scope reaches every session of the login whatever directory it is
launched from, so this is where a setting the fabric wants on every
agent goes. Every other key is kept as read. Prints one line in the
installer's shape (`+` written, `=` already current, `!` refused) and
exits 0; 1 when the file is unreadable, 2 on a usage error.

The keys, and why each is here:

`attribution` {commit "", pr "", sessionUrl false}. Claude Code builds
an attribution reminder from this key and injects it as a system
reminder on the first turn and again after every model switch, outside
any launch prompt — a `--system-prompt-file` does not remove it (read
back on 2.1.276, docs/live-checks/2026-09-18-attribution-reminder-off.md).
With no key set the reminder asks for a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer and a
"Generated with" footer, which policies/ban_generated_by_attribution.sh
refuses after the fact. An empty string hides each (the harness's own
schema: "Empty string hides attribution"), and with both hidden the
harness sends the opposite reminder — do not add attribution lines.
`sessionUrl` false drops the `Claude-Session:` trailer a web or Remote
Control session would add. The guard stays as the fence. The deprecated
`includeCoAuthoredBy` said the same thing; the key replaces it.

`env.DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` "1": the fleet's Claude Code version is the one
runtime/claude-code/harness.json pins, moved by `fabric-ctl … upgrade
claude` and nothing else. `autoUpdates: false` in ~/.claude.json is NOT
that switch on a native install: the harness honours it only when
`autoUpdatesProtectedForNative` is not true (2.1.282, read from its
binary), and the coordinator's account, native and protected, installed
2.1.282 on its own on 2026-09-24. DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER is checked first,
unconditionally; it stops background updates only — `claude install <v>`,
which the upgrade uses, still works (DISABLE_UPDATES would stop that too).
Every other `env` key is kept as read.

`showThinkingSummaries` true and `verbose` true (the owner, 2026-09-20):
an agent's session is read by the person operating the fleet, not only
by the agent — the thinking summaries and the full tool output are what
lets a stalled or misdirected session be seen for what it is from its
terminal, rather than reconstructed afterwards from a transcript.

`permissions.allow`: `Bash(<name> *)` for every command in
runtime/claude-code/commands.json — the fabric's own commands, which
bootstrap links into ~/.local/bin (the owner, 2026-09-26: no approval
for any fabric script or executable). A narrow rule, one command name
each — never one in its `not_allowed`, a wrapper that runs another
command — because in auto mode a narrow Bash rule is resolved before the
classifier while a broad one, or one naming Monitor, is set aside; a
Monitor follows the Bash rules. Every other rule the account allows,
denies or asks is kept as read, and an `ask` rule still wins.

`permissions.defaultMode` "auto" (the owner, 2026-09-26): every agent's
session starts in auto mode. Eight accounts provisioned by hand had no
mode and started in the default one, asking for what the classifier
would allow; the allow rules above assume auto.
