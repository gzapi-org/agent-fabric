# ONE classifier for "is this commit a review fix" — the count rule
# (root CLAUDE.md §When to open a NEW PR: 8–16 WORK commits arm at the
# review gate, under 8 ask the owner or state a class, over 16 is
# advice for the next batch; review fixes never count) is applied by
# pr-gate.sh on open PRs and measured by
# pr-compliance.sh on merged ones, and two copies of the regex would
# drift the band between them.
#
# A review FIX is a subject that names a REVIEW (review, re-review,
# finding(s), nit(s), as words) AND says it answers one (a finding label
# F3/N1/P2, fix/address/answer, a round, a #PR, or a nit or finding word
# again) — or carries a finding label AND a #PR with no review word at
# all, the supplier's shape "(#861 F6)". Either half alone misreads this repository: the review word
# alone made "admin driver review: approving …" and "the review
# decision's reason" fixes; a fix: opener alone made 804 of the last
# 3000 subjects fixes — this repository writes bug fixes as fix(scope):
# — and turned a "split" into an "arm" on #757 (2026-09-18 re-review,
# F1). Measured on those 3000: 95 read as fixes, e.g. "review F4: …",
# "…: address the blind review of …", "review fixes: …", "…the
# re-review findings on 8c4ae884".
#
#   commit_class <parents> <subject> [<answers>]   → prints merge | fix | work
#
# <parents> is the space-separated parent list (git log %P): two or
# more parents is a merge, whatever the subject says. <answers> is the
# value of the commit's `Answers:` trailer (git log
# %(trailers:key=Answers,valueonly)), empty when absent.
#
# THE TRAILER, `Answers: <finding labels>`, is read FIRST: a commit that
# carries it is a review fix whatever its subject says. It exists
# because the third shape a regex cannot reach appeared on #892
# (backend-dev-02, 2026-09-19, seq 2821): a fix commit whose subject
# describes the fix and names no review at all — "db: 0055's guard was
# too broad and stopped the file re-applying" — three of them read as
# work, 18 > 16, and the ceiling refused a PR that held 15. The
# information is absent from the prose; only the author can put it
# back, and a trailer is where a git message keeps facts about itself.
#
#     Answers: F3
#     Answers: PE-6, PR-1
#     Answers: re-review F1 (the \b rationale)
#
# Any non-empty value counts. The regexes below stay for every commit
# written before the trailer existed and for the habit that will not
# take.

# A finding LABEL is one or two capitals, an optional dash, digits, an
# optional -digits: F4, P3, N12, G1, PE-6, PR-1, P3-1. The first shape
# was [FNP][0-9]+ and read "review PE-6:" and "review PR-1:" as WORK —
# four of them on #883 inflated the count from 8 to 13, the direction
# the floor exists to catch (backend-dev-02, 2026-09-18, seq 2736).
# Case-sensitive on purpose: "v2", "utf8", "sha1" are not labels; a
# three-letter run (ADR-071, OTP) is not either.

    # A subject that OPENS with the review word AS THE SCOPE is an

    # wider opener read two work commits on agent-fabric #25 as fixes
    # and reported a five-commit PR as two of work. Such a subject falls
    # through to the general rule, which still needs an answer word.
