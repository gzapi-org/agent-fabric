# runtime/github/post-review.sh (lifted from the first managed project's tools/gh/ on 2026-09-19 — the commit names it; general to every managed project, whose own tools/gh/ copy is a forwarder through projects/<id>/integration/gh/)

# >>> help
# Post THE review of a PR — the review class's blind review — as a
# review object, marked so the tooling counts it as coverage of the head.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every session pushes as the SAME GitHub account, so a
# review the review class wrote is indistinguishable from the author's
# own thread reply by account alone, and pr-review-status.sh used to
# bucket both as "self reviews … not coverage". Prose attribution drifts
# — three sessions wrote three different sentences — and a coverage
# claim guessed from prose is worse than none. So every review this
# script posts is a REVIEW OBJECT (never an issue comment, which is not
# a review) and carries REVIEW_MARKER (below) as its first line, the
# exact string pr-review-status.sh tests for.
#
# The review class is the review. There is no automated reviewer it
# stands in for: the fabric dispatches a blind reviewer for every PR
# (runtime/claude-code/agents/code-review.md, briefed by bin/fabric-review),
# and this is how that review reaches the PR and the gate.
#
# Usage:
#   post-review.sh <pr> [options]   # body on stdin
#
#   post-review.sh 552 <<'EOF'
#   Found a P1 in the ownership guard: a four-segment branch typed
#   `Fix/` was classified unowned, so pr-reply.sh would post to it.
#   EOF
#
# Options:
#   --model <name>   record which model produced the review (default: unset)
#   --dry-run        show what would be posted, send nothing
#   -h, --help
#
# The body arrives on STDIN and is never interpolated into a command
# line — the same rule, and the same reason, as pr-reply.sh: a body
# quoting `backticks` or $vars passed through `-f body="…"` is expanded
# by the shell before gh sees it, and that has already posted a mangled
# comment in this repo.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  posted
#   2  invocation problem, or the PR belongs to another session
# <<< help

# THE CONTRACT, in one string. pr-review-status.sh greps for exactly
# this; test_post-review.sh and test_pr-review-status.sh both
# pin it, so changing it here without changing the reader is caught.
# Versioned because a later field addition must not silently reclassify
# older reviews.
