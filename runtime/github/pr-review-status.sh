# >>> help
# Has THE HEAD of this PR been reviewed — by a reviewer other than the
# author, or by the review class's blind review? A raw `gh pr view`
# cannot answer that.
#
# Two GitHub behaviours make the obvious reading wrong, and both bit
# this repo:
#
#   1. Replying to a review thread (addPullRequestReviewThreadReply)
#      creates a REVIEW object with an empty body, authored by you.
#      Three self-replies look like three new reviews. On one PR that
#      made a self-authored thread look like independent coverage.
#
#   2. A review comment's `commit_id` is re-anchored to the CURRENT
#      head whenever the file it points at has not changed. A finding
#      written against an old commit therefore DISPLAYS as though it
#      were evaluated against code that did not exist when it was
#      written. `original_commit_id` is the honest field.
#
# So: classify by MARKER then by AUTHOR, and compare each counted
# review's commit against headRefOid. Everything else is noise.
#
# WHAT COUNTS. Three buckets, reported on their own lines:
#   independent reviews — review objects by an account other than the
#                         PR author (every session pushes as one account,
#                         so this is a person or another organisation
#                         member, not another session);
#   blind reviews       — the review class's reviews, posted by
#                         post-review.sh as review objects whose FIRST
#                         LINE is REVIEW_MARKER (below): the fabric's
#                         review of every PR, dispatched by the session
#                         that owns it and judged before it is answered;
#   self reviews        — the author's own thread replies; not coverage.
# A head is reviewed when an independent or a blind review targets it.
#
# An AUTOMATED REVIEWER is not assumed. A project that runs one names
# its accounts in AGENT_FABRIC_VERDICT_AUTHORS (a JSON array); then a
# comment from one of them naming `Reviewed commit: <sha>` counts as a
# verdict on that sha, the phrases in AGENT_FABRIC_REVIEWER_REFUSAL_RE
# read as that reviewer declining (exit 5, the cause named), and a
# comment matching AGENT_FABRIC_REVIEW_REQUEST_RE reads as a pending
# request. All three are empty by default: no verdicts, no refusals, no
# requests — the review class is the review.
#
# WAITING (--wait). Nothing reviews a push by itself: a session
# dispatches the review class and posts its review. So `--wait` is for
# a review known to be in flight (another session's, a person's), and
# there are two "no review yet" states:
#
#   * never reviewed          — wait, up to the timeout.
#   * reviewed, then pushed   — nothing will arrive on its own; a
#                               re-review of the new range is owed.
#                               Exits 5 IMMEDIATELY with the cause,
#                               rather than burning the timeout.
#
# ...on an OPEN pr. A MERGED pr keeps waiting (a review can still land
# on it); a pr CLOSED without merging ends the wait at 1.
#
# Usage:
#   pr-review-status.sh <pr-number> [owner/repo] [options]
#
# Options:
#   --wait <duration>      poll until the head is reviewed (default 0 =
#                          answer once and exit)
#   --interval <duration>  between polls (default 30; the API is rate
#                          limited and reviewers are slow)
#   -q, --quiet            no progress lines on stderr
#   -h, --help             this text
#
# Durations take an optional unit — 90, 90s, 10m, 2h. A bare number is
# SECONDS.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the current head has at least one counted review — ANY of them,
#      not merely the most recent, which can be older by commit than
#      one submitted before it — or a configured reviewer's verdict
#      comment naming it
#   1  it does not — nothing yet, --wait expired still waiting, or the
#      pr was closed without merging
#   2  invocation problem (no gh, not authenticated, unknown PR), or the
#      pr could not be read — including a reviews or comments lookup that
#      FAILED, which is never reported as "no reviews"
#   5  no review is COMING on its own, on an OPEN pr: the head advanced
#      past every counted review with none requested — a re-review is
#      owed — or a configured automated reviewer declined (the `decline
#      reason` line says which phrase). Never returned for a merged pr.

        # is past the window. The alternative bound, the committer date,
        # fails in the direction that matters more — it makes exit 5
        # unreachable on any rebased head.
        # SCOPED TO THIS PR'S REF, because a check suite belongs to a
        # commit and a commit can appear in more than one place. Both
        # terms are load-bearing.

        # The unfiltered lookup returns every suite the SHA ever had —
        # another branch, an earlier PR, an earlier appearance on this

        # PR's ref update. An ask made in between reads as newer than
        # the head, stays falsely in flight, and the exit-5 callback
        # never fires.
        #
        # `pull_requests` alone is not enough to fix that, because how
        # GitHub populates it is UNDOCUMENTED: the REST reference
        # describes the field's shape and never states the match rule,
        # so "same sha, same repo" cannot be ruled out. Under that rule
        # a suite raised by any branch sharing this sha would carry this
        # PR number, and since a sha really can hold several suites
        # minutes apart — 2d4e1844 here has one at 12:19:33 from the
        # merge-queue ref and one at 12:31:52 from main — the latest of
        # them would date the head from a push this PR never had. That
        # overshoots, and an ask in between then reads as stale: a
        # premature exit 5, the confidently-wrong direction.
        #
        # `head_branch` is the term that does not depend on the unknown
        # rule. A suite raised by a push to this PR's ref carries this
        # PR's branch by construction, and one raised anywhere else
        # cannot, whatever `pull_requests` says. The PR number then
        # still earns its place: a branch can outlive the PR opened from
        # it, so the same ref can carry suites belonging to an earlier
        # one.
        #
        # EARLIEST of this PR's suites, and the direction is the whole
        # point. A sha can acquire a later suite on this same ref, under
        # this same PR number, from something that never moved the ref:
        # a manual `workflow_dispatch` against the branch (this repo has
        # dispatch-only workflows), a schedule, a re-run, or a
        # close/reopen — `reopened` is a default `pull_request` activity
        # type and the bare trigger in ci.yml fires on it. Taking the
        # LATEST dates the head from whichever of those happened last,
        # an ask made before it reads as stale, and a review sitting on
        # an earlier commit turns that into "no review is coming" while
        # the one asked for is in flight. That is the confidently-wrong
        # direction and it is NOT self-correcting: nothing prompts a
        # re-ask.
        #
        # Filtering by what RAISED the suite cannot fix this. The
        # workflow-run listing exposes `.event`, which is
        # `pull_request` for `opened`, `synchronize` AND `reopened`
        # alike — the activity type is not in the API (checked: no
        # `action` field on a run) — so a reopen is indistinguishable
        # from a push by event name. Ordering is the term that does not
        # depend on telling them apart: whatever a later suite was
        # raised by, it is not the push that created the head.
        #
        # Taking the earliest fails only in the safe direction. It can
        # date the head EARLIER than the true ref update (a branch
        # pushed before its PR existed carries no PR number until the PR
        # opens), which makes an ask read as newer than the head and
        # stay in flight — a longer wait, the trade this whole block is
        # written around. It can never date the head later than a
        # candidate suite, which is the failure that produces a false
        # exit 5.
        #
        # This REPLACES the earlier preference for the latest suite,
        # which existed for one case: a sha pushed, replaced, then
        # restored by force-push, where the oldest suite dates the head
        # from the first appearance and an ask made while the
        # intervening head was current stays falsely in flight. That
        # case is rarer than the ones above (no PR in this repo has ever
        # been force-pushed OR reopened; §Always forbids force-pushing
        # without an explicit request), and its failure is the SAFE
        # direction — "stays in flight" is a longer wait, not a verdict.
        # The old choice traded the safe failure for the unsafe one.
        #
        # Suites from `merge_group` or a push to main carry another ref
        # and drop out, which is right. So do ALL of them once the PR
        # is merged and its branch deleted: GitHub empties
        # `pull_requests` then, so
        # a merged PR — which this command deliberately keeps polling —
        # falls through to the commit date below. That is a degradation,
        # not a failure, and it is why the fallback is not optional.
