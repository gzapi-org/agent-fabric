# Which SESSION owns which PR, newest first.
#
# Every PR in this repo carries the same GitHub author, because every
# session pushes with the same credentials. `gh pr list` therefore shows
# one name against all of them and answers nothing about who is doing
# what. The session identity lives in the BRANCH NAME instead — the
# repo-root CLAUDE.md mandates
#
#     <hostname -s>/<clone-dir-basename>/<type>/<short-desc>
#
# so the first two segments are the session, and everything after is the
# work. This script reads that, and marks the rows belonging to THIS
# clone so "mine vs theirs" is visible at a glance — which is what the
# stay-in-your-own-lane rules turn on: never push to, rebase, delete or
# answer reviews on another session's branch.
#
# DEFAULT SCOPE: run inside a clone, and it shows THAT clone's PRs.
# Asking "which PRs are mine" from inside a working tree is the common
# case, and the clone you are standing in already answers it — so that
# is the default rather than something to remember a flag for. Pass
# /all to see every session.
#
# (There is no unscoped-outside-a-repo case to describe: `gh pr list`
# needs a repo context and fails first, so the script never gets that
# far. The empty-ME branch below is belt-and-braces for a future
# --repo flag, not a path you can reach today.)
#
# /unattributed IS THE THIRD SCOPE, and it exists because the other two
# cannot reach these rows. A branch that does not parse — dependabot's,
# a pre-convention `feat/x`, whatever /install-github-app names its own
# — belongs to no session, so every scoped run drops it and /all merely
# stops filtering rather than selecting it. The count in the NOTE said
# how many were hidden and no invocation could list them, which is a
# backlog nothing surfaces: four such PRs sat on seven unresolved P1/P2
# threads for a month, invisible to every session's sweep because no
# session owned them. Scope to them directly and they are answerable.
#
# The pairing that matters is `/unattributed /unresolved`: scope is
# applied BEFORE the thread lookup's candidate slice, so narrowing to
# the unowned rows first is also what gets their threads queried at all
# — under /all they compete for the same 100 slots as every recent PR
# and lose, being by definition the older ones.
#
# Usage:
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh                 # THIS clone's PRs (default)
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /all            # every session
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /unattributed   # only PRs no session owns
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh -n 50           # last 50 rows
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /OPEN           # open PRs only
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /MERGED         # merged only  (/CLOSED too)
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh --session gzapp-claude3
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /all --by-session   # grouped, all sessions
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /lastItem:50    # pool = 50 most recent PRs
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /lastDate:2d    # pool = updated in the last 2 days
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /lastDate:6h /unresolved   # ...then filter
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /unresolved     # only PRs with an open thread
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /all /unresolved # ...across every session
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh /unattributed /unresolved  # ...owed by nobody
#
# State is chosen at FETCH time, so like /lastItem and /lastDate it
# narrows the pool before scope, /unresolved and -n ever see it.
#   runtime/github/pr-sessions.sh --no-threads    # skip the review-thread lookup
#
# /lastItem and /lastDate narrow the POOL, and are applied BEFORE
# everything else — session scope, /unresolved and -n all operate on
# what they leave behind. That is what separates them from -n: -n trims
# the printed page, these decide what was ever considered.
#
# The THR column counts UNRESOLVED review threads. These no longer gate
# a merge (required_review_thread_resolution went off 2026-08-06), which
# is precisely why the column matters: a PR can merge with findings
# outstanding, so this count is the only place they surface. A
# trailing "!" means the last word in at least one of them is NOT the
# PR author's, i.e. somebody is waiting on a reply. "2" without the
# bang means you answered and simply have not resolved the threads.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  listed (even if the result is empty)
#   2  invocation problem (no gh/jq, not authenticated, bad flag)

# Session = first two path segments of the branch. A branch that does
# not follow the convention (dependabot, a hand-made name) is reported
# as "(unconventional)" rather than silently mis-attributed — a wrong
# owner is worse than a visible unknown.
#
# "Follows the convention" is checked against the WHOLE shape,
# <host>/<clone>/<type>/<desc>, not just "has enough slashes". Counting
# segments alone reported `dependabot/nuget/apps/backend_dotnet/…` as a
# session called "dependabot/nuget", and the footer then told you that
# apparent owner was a parallel session to stay out of the way of. The
# separator is therefore a deny-list of automation vendors, not an
# allow-list of type words — see `conventional` below for why the
# asymmetry is deliberate.
# Rows whose branch does not parse as <host>/<clone>/<type>/<desc>
# cannot be attributed to a session, so any scope filter removes them.
# COUNTED, because removing them silently is how a listing looks
# complete when it is not — the answer a reader acts on is the one that
# says "nothing outstanding".
#
# Counted in the SAME pass that builds the rows, and from what is left
# after /lastDate and /lastItem have narrowed the pool. A separate pass
# over the unnarrowed rows would announce PRs the caller never asked
# about: `/lastItem:1` would name an unscopable PR that was outside the
# one-item pool and had therefore not been omitted by anything. Sharing
# the pipeline is what keeps the two answers about the same set by
# construction, rather than by two pipelines happening to agree.
# RETIRED CLONES. A prefix that parses as a session may name one that was
# retired and replaced. Its PRs keep the old prefix forever, so without
# this they appear in nobody's sweep: not the successor's (different
# name), not /unattributed (the branch parses).
#
# THE RECORD IS agent-fabric's the project's .agent-fabric/legacy-registry/bindings.jsonl
# -- the working copies that existed under the directory-bound identity
# model, kept as migration data. New sessions are agents (logins), which
# are not registered and do not retire when a directory does; this
# succession logic applies to the legacy prefixes only.
# A clone is retired when every window for it is
# closed. A retired clone WITH a successor is OWNED by the successor --
# scoped into its default sweep, marked as its own -- while still
# DISPLAYING the retired name, because that is where the work lives. One
# with no successor is nobody's and joins the /unattributed rows. Anything
# the registry does not positively record as retired stays LIVE, which is
# the pre-existing behaviour.
#
# SUCCESSION IS RESOLVED TWICE, most reliable first.
#
#   1. clone_id CONTINUITY. A working copy that is renamed keeps its
#      clone_id, so the row that closed and the row now open are the same
#      clone under two names. That is exact, and it is how
#      gzapp-architect-cto -> architect-cto-01 resolves. Nothing about the
#      directory NAME is consulted: names carry no scheme to key on --
#      some clones are numbered (backend-dev-01, backend-dev-02) and some
#      are not (db-admin, devex-tooling) -- so any rule reading the name
#      would be guessing.
#
#   2. A UNIQUE live holder of the same role on the same host. The
#      fallback for a genuinely new working copy that took over a retired
#      one's work, where no clone_id links them.
#
# THE FALLBACK REQUIRES EXACTLY ONE HEIR, and that is the point rather
# than an edge case. A role is a slug (`backend-dev`), while a clone is a
# working copy, and one role can be held by two live clones at once --
# backend-dev-01 and backend-dev-02 both do. The first version took
# $heirs[0], so with two holders it silently handed a retired clone's PRs
# to whichever sorted first, letting the WRONG session reply and refusing
# the right one. Ambiguous now means unowned: the rows surface under
# /unattributed, where a person can see them, instead of being quietly
# misassigned. Record a rename (which keeps the clone_id) to make it exact.
# The legacy clone record is a PROJECT fact (projects/registry.json,
# `legacy_clone_bindings`, a path inside the project's working copy);
# a project that never had directory-bound clones simply has none, and every
# older-prefix branch then reads as live. AGENT_FABRIC_CLONE_BINDINGS (or the
# older GZAPP_CLONE_BINDINGS) overrides it — visibly, below.
