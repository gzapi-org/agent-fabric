# runtime/github/test_post-review.sh (lifted from the first managed project's tools/gh/ on 2026-09-19 — the commit names it; general to every managed project, whose own tools/gh/ copy is a forwarder through projects/<id>/integration/gh/)
#
# Behavioural tests for post-review.sh.
#
# What this exists to hold still: the MARKER. The review class's review
# is authored by the same GitHub account as every other session's work,
# so nothing but an exact marker distinguishes it from a thread reply —
# and pr-review-status.sh greps for that exact string. A marker that
# drifts on one side turns real review coverage back into "0 reviews",
# silently, which is the failure this whole mechanism was built to end.
#
# Driven through the real script with a mocked `gh` on PATH.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions passed
#   1  one or more assertions failed
