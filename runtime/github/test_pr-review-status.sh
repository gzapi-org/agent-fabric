# runtime/github/test_pr-review-status.sh (lifted from the first managed project's tools/gh/ on 2026-09-19 — the commit names it; general to every managed project, whose own tools/gh/ copy is a forwarder through projects/<id>/integration/gh/)
#
# Behavioural tests for pr-review-status.sh.
#
# The script exists because two GitHub behaviours make the obvious
# reading wrong — a self-reply registers as a REVIEW, and a comment's
# commit_id is re-anchored to the current head. Both produce the SAME
# dangerous answer: "this was reviewed" when it was not. So the tests
# that matter most are the ones asserting a NON-zero exit on input that
# superficially looks reviewed.
#
# The waiting half adds a second dangerous silence: a PR that was
# reviewed and then pushed to will never be reviewed again unless asked,
# and a tool that waits out its timeout there reports "not yet" for a
# state that is permanent. That must exit 5, immediately, without
# sleeping.
#
# The mock serves one scripted poll per `gh pr view` call, so a case can
# say "unreviewed, unreviewed, reviewed" and assert where the loop
# stopped.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions passed
#   1  one or more assertions failed

# An assertion calling a function nobody defined prints "command not

# reporting success with that case vacuous — a guard claiming coverage
# it does not have, in a file whose whole job is stopping exactly that.
# It has happened twice here: test_pr-review-status.sh's merged-pr case
# called `ok`/`bad` and ran for weeks doing nothing, and its verdict
# cases were written with `assert_not_contains` where this file's
# helpers are named otherwise.
#
# Every suite needs this, not just the one that was bitten: the helpers
# are NOT named alike across these files — two spell it `assert_lacks`,
# two `assert_not_contains` — so anyone moving between them types the
# wrong name eventually.
#
# THE MARKER FILE IS THE MECHANISM, and a counter is not. Bash runs
# `command_not_found_handle` in a SUBSHELL, so `failures=$((failures+1))`
# inside it is discarded when that subshell exits: the handler prints its
# complaint and the suite still reports "all assertions passed" and exits
# 0. The first version of this guard did exactly that — a vacuous guard
# against vacuous guards. A file written in the subshell survives it.

# The script under test runs as a separate `bash` process, so none of
# this reaches it or masks a genuine missing-command path there.
