# Do these branches combine? Merge them, in the order given, onto the
# base in a throwaway worktree, optionally run the project's own check
# on the result, say what happened, and remove the worktree.
#
# THE QUESTION IT ANSWERS. A change that depends on another agent's
# branch has to know the two combine before it is armed, or before "the
# code is on a branch" is taken as enough of a dependency. CI and the
# merge queue test a PR against main only, never with a sibling it
# depends on, and folding the sibling into one's own clone froze that
# clone for twenty minutes or left a hand-made worktree behind
# (2026-09-26). This answers from the side, and touches nothing of the
# caller's: its HEAD, index, working tree and branches are as they were.
#
# WHAT IT SAYS
#   combines           every ref merged; the resulting tree hash is given
#   conflicts          <ref> did not merge, and the conflicted paths
#   could not merge    <ref> failed for another reason (git's line is given):
#                      unrelated histories, a missing object — never read
#                      as a conflict. The clone's hooks are not run: this
#                      merge is never committed anywhere.
#   check passed       (--check) the project's check passed on the result
#   check failed       (--check) it ran and failed; its last lines are shown
#   check unavailable  (--check) it could not say: timed out, not found,
#                      its lease still held, or its verdict line missing —
#                      never read as a pass
#   check not run      the refs did not combine, so there is nothing to check
#   The shas tried are printed: a result is true for those shas only, and
#   says nothing of branches not named or of the base after it moves.
#   It reserves, pushes and decides nothing.
#
# THE CHECK is the project's: projects/<id>/integration/gh/trial.json in
# agent-fabric, found from this clone's remote —
#   {"check": ["make", "trial-check"], "timeout_s": 600,
#    "verdict": "^trial-check: (PASS|FAIL|UNAVAILABLE)", "lease": "..."}
# check is an argv run in the worktree (never through a shell). verdict,
# when set, is read from the output's last matching line and wins over the
# exit code (make exits 2 for every kind of failure); a declared verdict
# that never appears is unavailable, whatever the exit code. lease, when
# set, runs it under that host lease (fabric-lease), so two agents' builds
# queue instead of overloading the host — leave it unset when the check
# takes a lease itself. A project that declares none gets merge-only
# results, and --check says so. A fresh worktree has no build cache, so a
# compiled check starts cold.
#
# Usage:
#   runtime/github/trial-merge.sh <PR number | branch>... [--base <ref>] [--check] [--json]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  combines (and, with --check, the check passed)
#   1  conflicts, or the check failed
#   2  could not try (a failed fetch, a ref not on origin, no room, bad
#      usage, a merge that failed without a conflict), or the check was
#      unavailable
#
# Environment (the self-test):
#   AGENT_FABRIC_TRIAL_CONFIG   path of the trial.json to use instead of the project's
#   AGENT_FABRIC_TRIAL_MIN_FREE_KB   free space the worktree needs beyond its size (default 1 GiB)
