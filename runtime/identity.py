"""runtime/identity.py — the one place agent identity is resolved.

    AGENT IDENTITY = the Linux login of the effective user   (`id -un`)

The agent's name comes from the operating-system account Claude Code (or
any other harness) is running under. Nothing else participates: not the
current directory, not the repository or clone name, not the branch, not
the project, not a session id, and not an environment variable. Those are
CONTEXT — attributes bound to the agent at runtime — and this module
resolves them separately so they can never be mistaken for the name.

    identity.py             the agent name
    identity.py --json      the full runtime context (agent + bindings)
    identity.py --cwd DIR   the context as seen from DIR

Runtime state (which role the agent holds, which project and working copy
it is on) lives OUTSIDE the repository, per agent:

    $AGENT_FABRIC_STATE_DIR/agents/<login>/binding.json
    default: ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/agent-fabric/agents/<login>/

Every other tool in agent-fabric — the role activator, the launchers, the
harvesters, the GZCoord runtime, the Claude Code hooks — defers to this
module (or to `bin/fabric-whoami`, which execs it). None of them derives
the agent name on its own.

The state layer (2026-09-16, docs/state-layer.md). Every file under
`agents/<login>/` is written by this module and by nothing else:
`atomic_write` (a temporary beside the target, fsync, os.replace — the old
file stays whole through a crash or a full disk), `agent_lock` (a
re-entrant flock on `agents/<login>/.lock`; every read-modify-write of
per-agent state holds it, across processes), `update_binding` and
`append_history` on top of both. A binding is per (agent, host): one
written on another machine is refused by `read_binding` the way another
agent's is, so a shared home never carries a role from one host to the
next.
