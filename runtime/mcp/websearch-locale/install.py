"""runtime/mcp/websearch-locale/install.py — the MCP entry for the locale
search tool in a login's Claude Code user configuration.

    install.py <claude.json> set <fabric-websearch-locale> <locale.json> [--dry-run]
    install.py <claude.json> remove [--dry-run]
    install.py <settings.json> deny-websearch [--dry-run]
    install.py <settings.json> allow-websearch [--dry-run]

`set` writes (or leaves, when identical) mcpServers["websearch-locale"]
as a stdio server whose command is <fabric-websearch-locale> (bin/, which
runs the server on the fleet's pinned Python, ADR-040) with
WEBSEARCH_LOCALE_FILE set to <locale.json>; an entry that still runs the
Node server is this fabric's too and is rewritten in place. `remove`
deletes an entry that runs this fabric's server — recognised by the
path in its command or args — and never one the login wrote itself. `deny-websearch` adds "WebSearch" to permissions.deny in the
login's user settings — the harness's own search is not for a login
that searches through its locale (the launcher removes the tool at exec;
this is the fence for a session launched otherwise) — and records that
the fabric did, in permissions.deny's sibling marker
"WebSearch # agent-fabric"; `allow-websearch` removes both, and never a
"WebSearch" the login denied itself (no marker). Prints one line in the
installer's shape (+ = -) and exits 0. Both files are Claude Code's own:
every other key is kept as read.

A file that is not JSON is the login's to fix, and is left alone: one
line on stderr, then exit 0 for `remove` and `allow-websearch` (nothing
of the fabric's can be in force in a file the harness cannot read
either) and 1 for `set` and `deny-websearch` (theirs is not written).
It once raised here, and bootstrap ended in a traceback before the user
settings' own writer could refuse the file.
