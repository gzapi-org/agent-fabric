# Behavioural tests for moveto's target resolution — the half testable without
# spawning an interactive shell. `--print` exists for exactly this: it runs the
# whole resolution path and stops before the exec.
#
# WHAT THE MOCKS DO AND DO NOT PROVE. `getent` and `sudo` are replaced on PATH,
# because the fixture accounts do not exist and the suite must not need root.
# The sudo mock RECORDS the argv it was handed and then runs the command as the
# caller — so an assertion can check WHICH ACCOUNT was asked for, which is the
# tool's only privilege boundary, but nothing here proves the kernel honoured
# it. An earlier version of this mock silently discarded `-u`, and deleting
# both sudo gates from the tool left the suite green.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions passed
#   1  one or more assertions failed
