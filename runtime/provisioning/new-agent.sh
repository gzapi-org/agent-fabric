# runtime/provisioning/new-agent.sh — give a role its own account on this
# host: everything the control plane can do without a person at a

#   new-agent.sh <login> <role> --host <host-id> --project <id>      # on another host
#
# TWO HALVES (review, 2026-09-16). This script is the ORCHESTRATOR: it
# runs on the coordinator's host and keeps what only the coordinator
# holds — the registry, the Doppler administration, the API keys. The
# HOST half, runtime/provisioning/new-agent-worker.sh, runs on the host
# the account is placed on (runtime/hosts/registry.json; --host names a
# new placement) through runtime/hostexec/hostexec — directly on this
# host, over ssh to any other — in two phases around the Doppler steps:
# `prepare` (0-4) and `finish` (6-10). The host names itself (`hostname
# -s`, checked against the registry id) and the coordinator never stamps
# a host it is not on.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The host runbook (the managed project's docs/host/
# PROVISIONING.md) is twelve sections a person walks by hand, and twice
# on 2026-09-15 an account was walked through it in a session and came
# out short: a claude binary never installed, a root-owned ~/.local/bin,
# the GitHub host key never trusted so every SSH step failed as a
# password prompt, pnpm and node_modules absent, and — the one that
# mattered — a fill-from that copied the coordinator's admin keys into
# the new account's config. Each of those is one line here, checked
# before it is done, so the second account costs what the first did.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, in order (each step is skipped when already true):
#   0. the host: what this AppVM must already have and what it can hold.
#      A Qubes AppVM keeps only /home and /usr/local across a reboot; a
#      package is the TemplateVM's (dnf there, not here). So: the rpm
#      tools the fabric and the projects use (git, gh, node, npm,
#      python3, jq, gpg) are audited and a missing one is named with its
#      package for the template; doppler goes to /usr/local/bin once
#      (persistent), the account's own tools go under its ~/.local. What
#      a PROJECT needs of the host beyond that is the project's own
#      integration/provisioning/host-check.sh, run in finish. [worker: prepare]
#   1. the Linux account (useradd), home 700, the shared-cache group, and the
#      account persisted across the host's reboot (linger; on Qubes the record
#      snapshot under /rw — persist-accounts.sh)
#   2. ~/.ssh ~/.claude ~/.config/gh ~/.local/{bin,share}, owned by the
#      account; claude and ori installed AS THE ACCOUNT the way their
#      vendors say — `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s --
#      latest` — every account, the coordinator included, runs the
#      vendor's latest and the fabric is fixed where latest breaks it
#      (owner, 2026-09-16); --claude pins a version or stable — and `curl -fsSL
#      https://openrouter.ai/labs/ori/install.sh | bash` (stable channel;
#      it has no version pin) — both land in ~/.local/bin. An installer
#      that fails fails the script: nothing is copied from another
#      account in its place (owner, 2026-09-16).
#   3. github.com's published host keys (runtime/provisioning/github-host-keys)
#      in the account's known_hosts — never a keyscan
#   4. ~/projects/agent-fabric cloned over https (the fabric is public;
#      the account has no key yet) — enrolment reads the account's own
#      checkout for fabric-secrets                       [worker: prepare, 1-4]
#   5. Doppler enrolment: enroll.sh <login>, fill-from <coordinator>,
#      issue-openrouter-keys, issue-openai-keys, then sync — GH_TOKEN, the
#      relay token, the SSH key pair, the git identity strings, a key of
#      the account's own on each API                     [the coordinator]
#   6. every --project cloned AS THE ACCOUNT over SSH from the remote the
#      registry names (the key from step 5 is what makes this work)
#   7. bootstrap.sh as the account (workspace CLAUDE.md, hooks, agent
#      files, skills, core.hooksPath on every clone)
#   8. bin/fabric-role bind <role>, from the account's login shell
#   9. toolchain per project, from its lockfile: pnpm (installed under
#      ~/.local) and `pnpm install`, or `npm install`
#  10. verify: fabric-secrets status, gh, ssh to GitHub, git identity,
#      launch --print for both providers — and print what remains for a
#      person: the GPG secret key (a passphrase prompt; the runbook §4),
#      ~/.claude/.credentials.json for the plain-claude path (a
#      credential copy a classifier refuses an agent; §5), and the
#      workspace-trust dialog at the first interactive launch. [worker: finish, 6-10]
#
# NEVER: a secret value on the terminal (enroll.sh keeps them inside
# doppler calls); a copy of the coordinator's admin or provisioning keys
# (enroll.sh fill-from excludes them); a guess at a port offset (a row in
# the project's table is devex-tooling's to add, and the registry marks
# the name per login so fill-from never inherits one).
#
# FAILURE SEMANTICS (review, 2026-09-16 — before this, `run x; say done`
# announced success whatever x returned, and a failed useradd, clone,
# bootstrap or bind left a half-made account while later steps went on).
# Not `set -e`: half the lines here are questions. Every step names one
# of three:
#   must         the step is the account: a failure stops the script,
#                naming the step; nothing after it runs
#   probe        a question, never an error (is X present?)
#   best_effort  worth doing, not worth stopping for: a failure is one
#                warning line and the script goes on
# A pipeline that ends in sed/grep is judged by its FIRST command's
# status (${PIPESTATUS[0]}), never by the filter's.
# test_new-agent.sh runs the real sequence against fakes and injects a
# failure at each must.
