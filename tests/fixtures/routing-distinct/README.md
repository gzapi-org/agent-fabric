# routing-distinct

The routing column and effort file as they stood on 2026-09-24. On that
day every class on plain claude had a different model (Haiku 4.5,
Sonnet 5, Opus 5.5, Fable 5.1, and `claude-opus-5[1m]` for the review
class), and the levels ran from low to xhigh. On 2026-09-25 the owner
moved every class to Opus 5.5 at medium. A test of the mechanics needs classes it can tell apart, so it runs on
this frozen copy: `tests/test_routing.py` (every case built on
`scratch_root`), `tests/test_model_profile.py`,
`runtime/openrouter/test_launch.sh` and the dispatch guard's suite.
`tests/test_routing.py` asserts the committed policy itself.
