# tests/leak-check.sh — sourced by tests/run.sh: did the run leave anything
# under its temporary directory? (run.sh makes one per run and exports it
# as TMPDIR, so the snapshot is empty and everything left is the run's.)

#   leak_snapshot <dir>              → the directory's entries, one per line
#   leak_report <dir> <snapshot>     → prints every entry not in the snapshot,

# A test run leaves behind nothing it did not find (the owner, 2026-09-19).
# leak_dir is where the run's own directory is MADE — resolved as Node's
# os.tmpdir() does (TMPDIR, then TMP, then TEMP, then /tmp; Python reads
# TEMP before TMP, which stops mattering once run.sh exports TMPDIR for
# the run). The fabric sets TMPDIR on every account.
# Names are handled as whole lines: an entry with a space or a glob
# character is printed as itself, never split or expanded.
