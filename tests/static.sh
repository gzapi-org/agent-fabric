# A file URL's .pathname is percent-encoded, so handing it to the

# in twenty places across five suites and one module. The FIRST guard
# written here matched the inline spelling only — not the
# `const f = new URL(..., import.meta.url); … f.pathname` form, which is
# the one that had actually shipped — so it would have guarded nothing
# the fix had just removed. Hence a binding pass rather than a grep.
