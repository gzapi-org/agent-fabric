"""Behavioural tests for tools/fabric/assemble.py and tools/fabric/lint.py.

Stdlib only; runnable as `python3 test_assemble.py` or under pytest.

The assembler's value is that it is boring: distillers judge, and this puts
the results in the same place every time. So the cases here are about the
properties that make a drain reviewable — identical claims producing an
identical tree, an index that cannot drift from the files beside it, a
slice that splits before it grows past what a session can afford to load —
plus the two refusals that must never be silent: content that should not be
committed, and knowledge quietly duplicated into two roles that will
disagree later.
