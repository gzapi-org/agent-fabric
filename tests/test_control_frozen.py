"""The control plane's parity cases for ctl, upgrade, sessions and queue
(ADR-040 Wave 8), kept after the Node was deleted (step s8). Each case was run
through runtime/control/<module>.mjs and through the Python module, against
the same fixture homes, and the two answers compared byte for byte; the Node's
answers are frozen in tests/fixtures/node-oracle-ctl-upgrade-sessions-queue.json
beside the case's input and its Python body, and the Python side is run here
and compared with them. The cases are the old parity suite's, unchanged
(tests/parity_cases_{ctl,upgrade,sessions,queue}.py at origin/main before s8):
ctl's argv and every table over answered, forged and partial replies, upgrade's
argument check and marker bytes, the sessions' state records, the queue's CLI.
The cases of sign, protocol, presence, pool, jobs and gzcoord are frozen in
the test_control_* file of each module. A new input has no Node to ask: it is a
case of its own with an expected value written by hand."""
