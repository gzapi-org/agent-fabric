"""The GZCOORD/1 protocol suite's function cases, ported case for case from
communication/gzcoord/tests/protocol.test.mjs to the Python tools
(tools/fabric/gzcoord/, agent-fabric ADR-040 §7, Wave 7). The suite's
command cases were that file's too and are ported at the end of this one
(they run bin/gzmsg, bin/gzcoord-send and bin/gzcoord-inbox as processes
against a stub relay); a case that both calls a function and runs a
command is ported whole. Each
case keeps its name and its reason; where the Node's name for a function
differs (camelCase), the Python one is used. Plain script: prints ok/FAIL,
exit 1 on any failure."""
