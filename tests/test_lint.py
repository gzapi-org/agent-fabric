"""Behavioural tests for tools/fabric/lint.py.

Stdlib only; runnable as `python3 tests/test_lint.py`. Each case builds a
throwaway agent-fabric root in a temp directory, so nothing here touches
the real working copy. Fixtures copy the real schemas so schema validation
is actually exercised rather than skipped by `load_schema` returning None.

The corpus holds two kinds of markdown that look alike and are judged by
opposite rules. Knowledge slices carry provenance frontmatter and face the
role-template schema, the evidence rule, the budget and INDEX membership.
`identities/roles/<role>/skills/` and `commands/` hold installable payload
that role.py copies verbatim into `.claude/`, so their .md files carry
skill frontmatter and would fail every slice test at once.

The exemption is therefore narrow by construction, and each case below
pins one edge of it. **Each names the mutation it kills**:

  payload_is_exempt           <- reverting the payload branch; counting
                                 payload into `slices`
  hygiene_still_runs          <- exempting payload from the hygiene scan
  slices_are_still_linted     <- widening PAYLOAD_DIRS (e.g. adding "domain")
  exemption_is_anchored       <- widening PAYLOAD_DIRS; matching the dir
                                 name at any depth
  payload_shape_is_asserted   <- dropping payload_shape_findings
  index_need_not_list_payload <- reverting the payload branch; counting
                                 payload into `slices`

And the layout rules the split into identities/ and memory/ introduced:

  authored_classes_only_in_identities <- letting a charter-class slice
                                 into memory/ without evidence
  knowledge_not_in_identities <- letting a distilled slice sit beside the
                                 charter, where nothing indexes it
  index_lists_domain_slices   <- indexing only the project directory
  taxonomy_roles_are_catalogued <- a binding for a role nobody defined
