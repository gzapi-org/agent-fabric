"""tests/test_review_brief.py — the review constitution and the brief.

The reviewer's whole system prompt is runtime/claude-code/agents/
code-review.md, paid on every dispatch; the brief is what the dispatcher
puts in `prompt`. What holds still here: the agent file's frontmatter
(the pin rewrite, the tools allow-list, the Bash fence) is exactly what
the guards and install-agent-files.sh expect; the body stays under its
size cap and carries every section the design names; and the brief's
headings, once there is a renderer, are the ones the constitution says
it reads.
