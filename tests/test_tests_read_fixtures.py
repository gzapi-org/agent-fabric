"""Tests read instance fixtures, never this checkout's live instance files
(agent-fabric ADR-045 §5 rule 3): no test joins the checkout's own root
with an instance path. The scan reads source, as tests/test_roots_seam.py
does for engine modules, and shares its list of instance components.

A path is the checkout's when it is built on a name the file binds from
__file__ (ROOT, HERE, FABRIC = ...join(HERE, ...), followed through the
module's own assignments) or on __file__ itself: a join on a temporary
directory is a fixture, and is never flagged. ALLOWED names each file that
still does, with its reason; the guard fails for a file outside it, and for
an entry whose file no longer does (a stale entry hides the next one).

What a source scan cannot see, and this one does not claim to: a path
assembled in a loop from a tuple of strings, a whole directory copied
(shutil.copytree(ROOT/routing) carries routing/profiles.json), and a tool
run with AGENT_FABRIC_ROOT at the checkout that reads instance data itself.
Those are found by running the files on a copy of the tree with the
instance data removed, as the request's acceptance does:
tests/stripped_run.py <tree> <test file>... (seven files it found read the
registry, a role, memory/ or the auto-mode policy through the tools they
run, none of which this scan could flag)."""
