Turn distiller claims into the knowledge corpus, filed by scope.

    tools/fabric/assemble.py --claims DIR --drain DIR --project <project> --stamp DATE
    tools/fabric/assemble.py --bundle FILE|- --project <project> --stamp DATE

A BUNDLE is the drain as one tar with a manifest (harvest_memory.py
--bundle; bin/fabric-host <host> drain <login> streams one from the
account's own host). It is verified before anything is read from it:
every file the manifest names present with the digest it records, the
agent and host the same in manifest and report, nothing in the tar the
manifest does not name. A bundle that was cut short or changed on the
way is refused with the file named.

Where a slice lands is decided by tools/fabric/layout.py from its class:
domain knowledge under memory/domains/<role>/, everything learned about
the project under <working copy>/.agent-fabric/memory/<role>/ (the
project's own repository; fabric-coordinator's to write), multi-owner
slices under the matching shared/. The generated INDEX.md for each
(project, role) lists all of it with paths relative to the working copy
(fabric-side slices through ../agent-fabric/), plus the role's authored
charter and recall from identities/roles/<role>/.

Distillers judge; this assembles. A distiller emits claims and nothing
else — no files, no frontmatter, no index — because everything mechanical
belongs here where it is deterministic: same claims in, byte-identical
tree out. That property is what makes a drain reviewable as a content
diff rather than a diff of formatting noise.

What it does:

  * Places each claim in its class/topic slice, splitting a slice when it
    outgrows its token budget so no single file can quietly become
    enormous.
  * Writes provenance frontmatter: which observations a slice came from,
    and which clone and host produced them, so a claim stays auditable
    after the observation store has been archived and emptied.
  * Regenerates every role INDEX.md from slice frontmatter. The index is
    the only thing a session reads before deciding to load a slice, so it
    is generated rather than maintained — a hand-written index drifts.
  * Routes a claim owned by two or more roles to `memory/shared/` (or the
    project's own `shared/`), so
    knowledge two roles need lives once instead of in two copies that
    will disagree later.
  * Merges the citation graph into each role's crossref.json.
  * Runs the hygiene checks that must never reach a commit.

Merge mode is the default: existing slices are read, and a claim whose
`merge_target` names an existing section updates it instead of appending
beside it. Regenerating from scratch would discard accumulated curation,
so it is never done implicitly.

    """Rewrite a `files` reference into one that still resolves later.

    The crossref index earns its keep by outliving the observation
    buffer: ADRs, PRs, commits and migrations resolve against git and
    GitHub, so an entry stays answerable long after the session that
    recorded it is gone. A path into a session's scratchpad resolves
    against nothing. It names a directory that belongs to ONE session
    on ONE machine — `/tmp/claude-1000/<clone>/<session-uuid>/...` —
    and is already dead by the time anyone reads the index, while
    still looking like a file someone could open.

    Such references are collapsed to a `scratch:` pseudo-path. That
    keeps the provenance fact worth keeping (this knowledge came from
    a throwaway probe, not from tracked code, so there is no source to
    go read) while dropping the session identity that made it a lie.
    Non-`files` kinds pass through untouched.

    TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, each found by review:

    A `scratchpad/` segment is ephemeral only UNDER a session-temp
    root. `docs/scratchpad/decision.md` is a tracked file someone can
    open, and rewriting it to `scratch:decision.md` would delete a
    valid repository path from the citation graph — the opposite of
    what this exists for. The temp root is checked FIRST, and a path
    that is not under one is returned untouched whatever it is named.

    And two dead paths that share a basename are not the same
    artifact. `/tmp/run-a/probe.cs` and `/tmp/run-b/probe.cs` both
    reduced to `scratch:probe.cs`, so the assembler merged their
    observation and slice lists into one node and conflated unrelated
    provenance. A short digest of the ORIGINAL path distinguishes them
    and stays stable across drains — without reintroducing the session
    identity, which is the thing being dropped.

    moves and files gone, and an index-only run (no claims) wrote empty
    watermarks (a drain's blind review, 2026-09-25). A report of the SAME
