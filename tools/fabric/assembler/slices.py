    A drain across accounts is one run per bundle into the same working
    copy, and each run rewrote the report whole: the committed report
    described the last bundle alone, every earlier run's decisions, roles,
    moves and files gone, and an index-only run (no claims) wrote empty
    watermarks (a drain's blind review, 2026-09-25). A report of the SAME
    stamp is therefore the same drain and is merged into: roles and
    shared topics unioned, the lists appended without repeats, one
    decision per key (the later run's, as the tree now reflects it), the
    telemetry kept per source (agent@host) so re-running a bundle
    replaces its counts instead of adding them twice. A report of another
    stamp is an earlier drain, replaced — except its watermarks: each says
    where one account's store (agent@host) was read up to. A run replaces
    only the marks of the stores it harvested, with what that harvest
    says — lower too, since the harvester holds a mark below a memory it
    could not render yet, so the memory is read again — and a run that
    harvested nothing changes none. `title_collisions` is read from the tree,
    which already holds every run's result.

    The harvest record is kept per source too (`harvest_sources`), since
    each bundle read its own host's store; `harvest` stays the latest
    run's, for a reader of one. `files` keeps only what `exists` finds:
    a later run of the stamp may retire or move a file an earlier run
    wrote, and a report naming it counted it in `files_written` (a
    drain's blind review, 2026-09-26)."""
