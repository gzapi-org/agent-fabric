Nothing here names an agent: the hooks ask the OS who is running at
session start. Nothing here makes projects/ a git repository. A managed
project keeps its own CLAUDE.md and .claude/ for sessions launched inside
it. Re-running refreshes only what differs.

The projects directory defaults to the parent of this checkout — the
layout agent-fabric assumes is projects/agent-fabric beside the working
copies it manages.

CONTRACT, frozen from the bash (ADR-040 §5 rule 3):

  argv         [--projects DIR] [--dry-run], in any order. Anything else:
               "bootstrap: unknown argument X" on stderr, nothing on
               stdout, exit 2. --projects naming no directory, or with no
               value: one line on stderr, nothing on stdout, exit 1.

               (the user manager's bus; set to /run/user/<uid> for the

               the collation locale (LC_ALL / LC_COLLATE / LANG), which
               orders the working copies as bash's glob did. Everything
               else is passed on to the children as it is.

  exit         0 when the run reached its summary, NOT-written lines
               included; 2 a bad argument; 1 --projects names no

               (install's word: "bootstrap: install: …"), or the workspace
               settings are not a JSON object; 127 git missing, at the first

               install_agent_files' own non-zero status (nothing after the

               workingcopy.resolve, workspace_trust.main.
  relied on    new-agent's worker (runtime/provisioning/new-agent-worker.sh,
               step 7): exit status, the log's last lines on failure; the
               control agent's `upgrade fabric` (tools/fabric/control/upgrade.py):
               exit status, the last line on failure, and the stdout line
               "restart left to the caller"; moveto's enter: exit status
               only, output discarded, 30 s.

The helpers under runtime/ run on this interpreter, the fleet's pinned
Python, as ADR-040 §5 rule 4 has it for bootstrap's port: the bash ran
them on the host's python3 and stopped with 127 before step 2 without
one. Only step 7's venv, the language detector's own environment, is
still made with the host's python3; without it that step says so and the
run carries on.

DELIBERATE DEPARTURES from the bash, each a defect the oracle pinned as the
bash behaved, fixed here with its case changed:
  1. A working copy whose .agent-fabric-project marker names no registered
     project ended the whole run at step 5, silently, exit 1 (workingcopy.py
     failed inside the pid pipeline under pipefail and set -e): every copy
     after it, the trust, the units, langid and Doppler were skipped. Now
     one line on stderr names the working copy and why, it is counted NOT
     written, and the run carries on.
  2. A relay port held by a process ss could not name (no pid in its
     answer, or no ss on the host) ended the run at step 6b, silently, exit
     1 (grep -o failed inside the holder pipeline): the pgrep fallback and
     the "pid unknown" line were never reached, the relay not even
     enabled. Now ss, then pgrep, then "unknown", as intended.
  3. User settings that are not JSON ended the run in the agent files with
     a traceback from runtime/mcp/websearch-locale/install.py (allow- and
     deny-websearch read the file first), before user-settings.py could
     refuse it. install.py now says one line and leaves the file alone
     (exit 0 for allow-websearch and remove, which have nothing to take
     out of a file the harness cannot read either; exit 1 for set and
     deny-websearch, which cannot write theirs). On any login but a
     language-culture one the run carries on to user-settings.py's own
     refusal, counted NOT written; on a language-culture login the
     installer's deny-websearch is that exit 1, and the run ends in the
     agent files, said in install.py's one line, not a traceback.
  4. put() re-made a .before-agent-fabric backup each time a fabric file
     carrying no "agent-fabric" marker changed (the guard, three of the
     skills), so the second change replaced the person's original with the
     fabric's own previous file. Now a person's version is kept every time
     it differs from what the fabric last wrote, never over another backup
     and never twice (tools/fabric/fabric_writes.py), as the installer
     does.
  5. The systemd units went to ~/.config/systemd/user whatever
     XDG_CONFIG_HOME said; `systemctl --user` reads $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/
     systemd/user when it is set. Now the units go there.
Unpinned, and smaller: no temporary directory (the merge is in memory);
commands.json unreadable, and workspace settings that are JSON but not an
object, are one line rather than a traceback; install_agent_files is run
by this interpreter rather than through its shim; workingcopy and
workspace_trust run in-process on this interpreter.

Left as they are (reported, not decided here): the exit is 0 when the
summary has NOT-written lines; the agent files, steps 4, 5b and 7 are not
in the counts, and step 5's lines are counted in a dry run; some refusals
go to stdout ("  !  langid", "  !  workspace trust", a relay held) and
others to stderr.
