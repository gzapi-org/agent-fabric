"""tools/fabric/control/agentd.py — the control agent (ADR-040 Wave 8): the
Python port of runtime/control/agentd.mjs, which step s8 deleted; the unit
runs this file under the pinned fabric-python. One process per account, run as the
login: it answers the coordinator's requests on the control channel with
what the account can say about itself (control/ops), and carries out the
signed actions (upgrade, secrets-sync, jobs-add, local-prune,
secrets-selftest, pool-add, tools-install, gateway-install).

  python3 tools/fabric/control/agentd.py          the daemon: block, answer, repeat
  python3 tools/fabric/control/agentd.py --once   answer what is pending, then exit
  python3 tools/fabric/control/agentd.py --self   print this account's status, no relay

THE RULES OF THE CHANNEL, THE READ AND THE FENCE (carried over from the Node's
header, deleted in step s8):

THE CHANNEL. runtime/control/config.json names it (fabric:control) and
the relay — the same one the fleet's GZCoord traffic rides. A control
channel carries JSON records, not GZCOORD/1 messages, and no session
ever drains it (inbox.py refuses a channel ending in :control). There
is no point-to-point delivery: every agent reads every record and
answers the ones addressed to it (`to` its address, a list holding it,
or "*"); the coordinator reads the replies by `in_reply_to`.

THE READ. No consumer cursor and no ack: the relay's `since_id` is an
explicit cursor, so a restart never replays history — the agent primes
from the newest record on the channel and waits after it, 55 s a poll.
A `since_id_not_found` (the relay's history was cleared) re-primes.

THE FENCE, v1. A request is answered only when its `from` is a host
operator's address as runtime/hosts/registry.json places it — except a
PUBLIC op (control/ops PUBLIC_OPS: `presence`, `pool-list` and `pool-claim`), answered for any placed
<host>/<login>, since every sender needs it and a relay-token holder
could already get it by forging an operator's `from` on an unsigned
read op (pool-claim is the one unsigned op that writes: one field, the
claimant, ADR-029 §5 rule 4) — read
again for every record, so a pull that changes the registry counts at
once, and the identity section asks whoami() per request, so a rebind
shows without a restart (review, 2026-09-17) — (a claim,
not a proof — the relay verifies no sender; it stops any other session
from asking), its op is one of the closed set, its `ts` plus `ttl_s` is
not in the past, and its id was not seen before (an LRU of 256). An
ACTION op (sign.ACTION_OPS) additionally needs `sig`, an Ed25519
signature by the operator's committed key, lives at most 10 minutes,
and must be newer than the last action accepted from that operator (a
ledger in the account's fabric state), and no more than a minute in
its future. A read op takes no argument but `tokens`'s `days` (a number
capped at 90), pool-list's `role` and pool-claim's `id`; an action takes
only its closed set (check_args in control/upgrade.py and control/secrets.py,
check_job_args in control/jobs.py, check_pool_args in control/pool.py). No field of a
request ever reaches a shell; the answer carries no secret (control/ops).

Every reply arrives: a section that cannot be read says so inline.
Relay down: one line on stderr, retry every 30 s; a refused token is
re-read once from the synced file (a rotation), then reported.

CONTRACT, frozen from agentd.mjs. Kept byte for byte: every
record posted (key order, ids, timestamps' shape), every refusal's reason
text, every stderr line, the exit codes (0; 1 the relay failed in --once or
an unforeseen error; 3 no token or no host operator; 4 --once and the token
was refused), the order a request is checked in, the LRU of 256 seen ids,
the action ledger's file and shape, the 30 s retry and the 55 s poll.
The names that other modules import are as before: control_config, new_id,
operator_addresses, account_addresses, number_of.

WHERE THE PORT DIFFERS (each listed because a reader of the Node would look):
  - Threads stand where the Node had promises. An action (ACTION_OPS) and a
    disk read run in a thread beside the read loop; --once and a restart
    wait for them. The set of running ones is guarded by the leaver's lock,
    so a restart asked for while one is being started either waits for it or
    comes first, never between.
  - What a restart is: the Node watched the *.mjs and *.json files of its own
    directory. The Python daemon watches the files of the modules it has
    loaded (sys.modules, under the code root) and runtime/control/config.json:
    exactly what a pull can change under it, and nothing the Node alone
    loads. By polling (1 s) where the Node had inotify, after the same 2 s
    quiet period.
  - The ledger file: a file that holds an array is read as a ledger that
    holds nothing, as the Node read it (an array has none of the senders as
    keys), but is then written as the object it should have been; the Node
    wrote back `[]` and so never recorded the action. Its temporary file is
    removed when the write fails.
  - A timer that raises is said on stderr (`agentd: <name> failed: …`) and
    runs again; the Node's would have ended the process.
  - Exit from another thread (a restart) is os._exit after stderr is
    flushed: sys.exit would end the thread only.
  - SIGTERM is not caught, as in the Node: the process ends where it is and
    systemd's Restart= does the rest. SIGINT is an exit 130 without a
    traceback.
  - tools_opts (the `tools` op) and install_opts (the `tools-install` op) are
    two keys of the context; the Node's toolsOpts served both.
  - gateway-install (control/gateway.py, after the Node was deleted) and the
    `gateway` read are Python-only: gateway_install_opts and gateway_opts are
    their context keys.
