"""tools/fabric/control/gateway.py — the gateway's binary on this account:
`gateway-install`, a signed ACTION that puts the release the fabric pins in
~/.local/bin under the binary's own name, and `gateway`, the read that says
what is there (the gateway's ADR-014 rules 11, 17-19; the coordinator's
answers of 2026-10-10 to the shape proposed in seq 98283). The binary's name
is the last component of the pin's member, so no project's name is written
into this generic file.

THE PIN is runtime/gateway.json in this checkout (shape of runtime/python.json):
releases.<version>.<arch> holds the asset url, the tarball's name, its
SHA-256, the one member to extract and what that binary reports. The digest is
the reviewed one, never fetched from the artifact's own origin: a checksum
beside the artifact is changed by whoever changes the artifact.

THE ARGUMENTS are a closed set, {"version": "<digits.digits.digits>"}, and the
version must be a key of the pin. Nothing in a request names a url, a digest
or a path.

THE SEQUENCE, for one account, as that login and with no root:
  1. a lock for the account (a second install at once is refused, not queued);
  2. the installed binary is the pinned release already (the marker below says
     so and the file still has the digest the marker recorded): "current",
     nothing downloaded, nothing touched;
  3. download the pinned url with the account's GH_TOKEN, which the asset
     endpoint needs (the repository is internal), into a temporary file beside
     the target; size and time bounded; the token goes in a request header only
     — never argv, never a log, never the reply — and is dropped on the redirect
     to the storage host;
  4. the SHA-256 of what arrived must equal the pin's BEFORE anything is
     extracted or executed; a mismatch deletes the file and installs nothing;
  5. the one pinned member is read out of the tarball (no other member is
     looked at, and no path from the archive is used) into a temporary file in
     the target's directory, mode 0755;
  6. that file is run with `--version --json` and must report what the pin says
     it reports; a binary that cannot say who it is is "failed", not "installed";
  7. os.replace onto the target. A running gateway keeps the inode it started
     from and is never stopped (ADR-014 rule 19); the next launch uses the new
     file;
  8. the marker (<state>/gateway-install.json: version, artifact digest, binary
     digest) is written whole, by rename; one an install before the rename left
     at <state>/gateway.json, the launcher's session record, is moved to it.

THE REPLY, data["gateway-install"]: status "installed" | "current" | "refused" |
"failed"; version; sha256 (the verified artifact digest, the pin's); installed_sha256
(the digest of the file now at the path); path; contract (the runtime-contract
version the binary reported); reason on a refusal or a failure. A refusal is a
request the action will not take (bad arguments, a version the pin lacks, an
architecture it has no build for); a failure is an install that was tried or
could not start (no token, the network, a digest that differs, a binary that
disagrees with the pin).

THE READ, data["gateway"]: status "ok" | "absent" | "unreadable"; path;
installed_sha256; version and contract, as the installed binary reports them
under `--version --json`; release_sha256, the artifact digest the marker
recorded when it agrees with the file. Unknown stays unknown: a binary that
will not report is "unreadable", with the reason, never a guessed version.
