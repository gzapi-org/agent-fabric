"""tools/fabric/control/gzcoord.py — what the control plane needs of
GZCoord: ported from runtime/control/gzcoord.mjs (ADR-040 Wave 8; deleted in
step s8).

Who this account is, the role catalogue, the project's relay integration,
the token, the relay API, and whether the account's inbox is held. The
Node module carried its own copy of each, moved out of the GZCoord
scripts so the daemon would never depend on a script that became a shim
(ADR-040 §7, amendment 2026-10-04), and said "a change to what either
answers is made in both". The Python GZCoord tools (Wave 7) are that
other copy, so here they are the one: every name below but four is
theirs, under gzcoord.mjs's name in snake_case.

CONTRACT, frozen from gzcoord.mjs:
  FABRIC_ROOT, whoami, load_taxonomy, find_taxonomy     gzcoord.gzmsg
  integration_config, inbox_root                        gzcoord.inbox_parts.config
  token, synced_var, synced_token, identity             gzcoord.inbox_parts.tokens
  hold_status                                           gzcoord.inbox_parts.hold
  relay_failure, API_TIMEOUT_S, api_timeout_s, api, ApiError, shell_word
                                                        here: the control
                                                        plane's own, below

THE CONTROL PLANE'S API differs from the GZCoord tools' (inbox.mjs's
300 s), as gzcoord.mjs's did: a relay that accepts the connection and
never answers would hold a CLI for good and stop agentd reading
requests. So a call is bounded at API_TIMEOUT_S plus whatever the
request asks the relay to wait (/api/wait's timeout_seconds), body
included; a non-2xx answer is ApiError with its status, a 3xx too (no
redirect is followed); no answer in the bound is ApiError(timed_out=True)
— a post that timed out may have been stored, and the queue reads it as
unknown. It is http.client, not urllib: the relay directly, never a
proxy from the environment, and a timer that shuts the socket at the
deadline, so the bound holds whatever the relay trickles, headers and
body alike (review of e04c5593, F1).

WHAT IS NOT NODE'S: api takes its bound in seconds (timeout_s), not
milliseconds, and no abort signal: Python has none, so a caller with a
bound of its own passes it as timeout_s; API_TIMEOUT_MS is API_TIMEOUT_S.
WHOAMI_TIMEOUT_MS has no counterpart: Node ran `python3 identity.py`
under it, and the GZCoord tools import identity.py in this process,
which starts nothing to bound. The bound does not cover resolving a
relay's host name (getaddrinfo cannot be cut short); the relays the
projects configure are addresses, not names.
