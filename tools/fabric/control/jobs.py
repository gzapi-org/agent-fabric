"""tools/fabric/control/jobs.py — the job list on the control plane
(agent-fabric ADR-037 rule 6, ADR-029): ported from runtime/control/jobs.mjs
(ADR-040 Wave 8; deleted in step s8).

`jobs` is a read op: this account's open jobs, as bin/fabric-jobs holds
them, for an operator. Not public: peers see each other's presence, not
each other's lists. `jobs-add` is an ACTION (sign.ACTION_OPS): the
owner's job, added to this login's list with source `owner` and the
operator's address. Both run tools/fabric/jobs.py as this login, by argv
— no field of a request reaches a shell — with the root it was given, so
the tool and the identity it loads are one tree's; the arguments of
jobs-add are a closed set, checked before anything runs.

CONTRACT, frozen from jobs.mjs:
  PROJECT_SLUG, TITLE_MAX, TOPIC_MAX, PRIORITIES      as Node's
  jobs(home, root, run)      {"status": "ok", "jobs": [...]}, each job's
                             id, state, title, project, topic, priority,
                             source, blocked_on, artifacts, updated; a
                             failed list is JobsError
  check_job_args(args)       None, or why the arguments are refused
  jobs_add(request, home, root, run)
                             {"status": "added", "job", ["warning"]} or
                             {"status": "refused", "reason"}

The arguments are judged as JavaScript judged them, since a request may
come from a Node fabric-ctl during the rolling upgrade and must be
refused or run alike: a length is UTF-16 code units, trim() is
JavaScript's whitespace, String() of a value is JavaScript's (null is
"null", which a project slug matches, and then no --project is passed,
as Node passed none), `$` never before a trailing newline, and an
object's keys in JavaScript's order.

WHAT IS NOT NODE'S, where Node's refusal said nothing: its reason was
its error's stderr, the empty string, when jobs.py gave no answer within
the bound, exited non-zero saying nothing (or only "fabric-jobs:"), or
could not be started. Here the reason is "no answer within 15 s",
"exit <n>", or why it could not be started.

What crosses to jobs.py is what Node's execFile sent: each argument
String()-ed, a lone surrogate as U+FFFD (a title the operator signed
with one is added, as Node added it, not a crash); its output read as
UTF-8 with bad bytes replaced, never by the locale.
