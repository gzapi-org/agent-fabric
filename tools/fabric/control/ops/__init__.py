"""tools/fabric/control/ops — what a control agent can say about its own
account, as pure extractors: each takes its inputs (a home, a fetch, a
run) so a test runs them against a scratch home and a fake relay, and
each returns only fixed, whitelisted keys — never a value from a secret.
The fingerprints are the one place a secret is read: hashed in place,
twelve hex digits of its sha256, enough to tell two keys apart and
nothing else (the CEO, 2026-09-17: "the username it logs in with, or
the api key hash").

The port of runtime/control/ops.mjs and ops/*.mjs (ADR-040 Wave 8). The
replies are frozen with the wire: the same op names, the same keys in the
same order, the same statuses; a mixed fleet answers both ways. Where the
port differs, it is listed here:
  - A directory's entries are taken in sorted order where the Node took
    readdir's (memory rows, transcripts, leases, du's arguments): ties
    and rows come out the same on every run.
  - accounts: a read lock holding no positive pid is stale (the Node
    signalled pid 0, its own process group, and kept the account busy).
  - usage: no proxy, and a redirect is a failed read (urllib would carry
    the token to wherever a redirect names).
  - memory: a harvest that failed with nothing on stderr says why
    (a timeout, a missing interpreter), where the Node said "".
  - Every subprocess has a timeout, presence's pgrep included.
  - Every JSON parse refuses NaN, Infinity and a document nested past the
    stack, as JSON.parse did (a ValueError, handled where a bad document is).
  - tools reads the login's own state directory, not ctx["home"]'s: they
    are the same in production.
  - fabric-accounts login runs the harness with no timeout: a person is in it.
  - The read lock is created complete (pid written, then linked into place):
    a held lock is never empty. One naming no pid is stale after 5 s.
  - status: the sections' keys come in request order; the Node put each in
    as its section finished, so a synchronous one (session) came early.
  - disk: the two du scans run one after the other (the Node ran them
    together), so its worst case is twice the bound.
  - secrets-sync: `expect` must be a string of 12 hex digits; the Node also
    took a number or a list whose String() was one.

A section that cannot be read says so inline ({status: ...}) rather than
raising: a reply always arrives, and its gaps are named.

The extractors are synchronous; collect() runs a request's sections in
threads, as the Node ran them under one Promise.all.
