"""tools/fabric/control/pool.py — a role's open pool of jobs (agent-fabric
ADR-037 rule 9), held by one control agent so that one process orders
every claim: ported from runtime/control/pool.mjs (ADR-040 Wave 8;
deleted in step s8).

THE HOLDER is config.json's `pool_holder` when set; otherwise, with one
host in runtime/hosts/registry.json, that host's operator. With several
hosts and none configured no account holds it, and every pool op says
so: which agentd orders the claims is never guessed.

THE FILE is <state>/agents/<holder login>/pool.json, {seq, jobs: [...]},
written whole through a temporary file and a rename, as JSON.stringify
(doc, null, 2) lays it out: persisted state is frozen with the wire, and
a Node and a Python agentd read each other's. A file that cannot be read
is an error, never an empty pool: claims recorded in it would be handed
out again.

THE OPS. `pool-add` is an ACTION (sign.ACTION_OPS): the owner's job for a
role, a closed argument set — role, title, topic, project, priority — as
jobs-add checks it. `pool-list` and `pool-claim` are PUBLIC: any placed
account asks, for itself.

A CLAIM is checked against the claimant's binding as ITS control agent
reports it — the role in its newest state record on the state channel —
never a role the request names (the owner, 2026-10-08). No record from it
within STATES_STALE_MS (or within the newest STATES_REPLAY records, when
they reach back less) is a binding unknown, and the claim is refused. A
job has one claimant: a claim of a job another account holds is refused;
the same account claiming again gets it again.

SERIALIZED, by construction: every change to the file is one
read-modify-write that agentd runs in its loop, one request at a time,
and one agentd runs per account. What the relay verifies about a sender
is nothing: the fence is that a claim lands only on the claimant's own
list, written by its own fabric-jobs (rule 1).

CONTRACT, frozen from pool.mjs: POOL_FILE, POOL_ID, ROLE_SLUG,
pool_holder, read_pool (PoolError for a file that cannot be read),
by_priority, roles, check_pool_args, pool_add, pool_list,
role_from_stream, pool_claim — each answering {status, ...}, "refused"
with the reason the asker reads.

WHAT IS NOT NODE'S: the file's path is the caller's (Node's default was
upgrade.mjs's stateDir(), another port's), and so are STATES_REPLAY and
STATES_STALE_MS, ctl.mjs's, which this module states at their values
until ctl's port holds them. A write that fails is refused with
Python's text of the error (Node said "EACCES: permission denied, open
'…'"; Python "[Errno 13] Permission denied: '…'"). The file is read as
UTF-8 with bad bytes replaced, as Node's 'utf8' reads it. A pool or a
registry of a shape Node never writes is refused or names no holder
here: a job that is not an object (Node threw reading it), hosts that
is not an object or a host that is not one (Node named "0/user" for a
list, and threw for a null host).
