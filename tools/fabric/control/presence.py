"""tools/fabric/control/presence.py — whether accounts have a session, asked
of their control agents (the `presence` op) by any placed account:
ported from runtime/control/presence.mjs (ADR-040 Wave 8; deleted in
step s8). gzcoord-send runs it for an addressed message.

The sender's check before a message leaves is the caller: a message to a
login with no session waits in the relay until one starts, and the
sender decides whether that is what it wants (the owner, 2026-09-25).
The answer is the process table, not a claim a session made about
itself: a crash, or a launch that never reached the harness, is never
"present".

CONTRACT, frozen from presence.mjs:
  PRESENCE_WAIT_MS   GZCOORD_PRESENCE_WAIT_MS when a number above zero
                     (read as Number()), else 6000
  ask_presence(...)  {address: presence | None} for every address
                     expected; None is a control agent that did not
                     answer within wait_ms — unknown, never "offline"
  check_addressees(metadata, ...)
                     {checked, problems, notes}, as checkAddressees
  exit_code_of(answer)  0 checked, no problem; 4 a definite problem;
                     5 an addressee that did not answer; 6 unavailable
  cli(argv, stdin)   `presence.py check`: the request as one JSON object
                     on stdin {"metadata", "from", "token"} — the token
                     never in argv; stdout one JSON object (the answer,
                     or {"error", "status"}); exit as exit_code_of, or 2
                     for usage or unreadable stdin

The control plane's own pieces this reads — the channel's config, the
placed and operator addresses, a new id — are agentd's (control_config,
account_addresses, operator_addresses, new_id), taken as parameters and
imported only by the CLI; until agentd's port is in the tree the CLI
answers a well-formed request with exit 6 and an {"error"} saying so.

Requests, pages and replies are read as JavaScript read them, since a
Node sender and a Python one must check alike: the query as
URLSearchParams encodes it, stdin as JSON.parse takes it (no NaN), a
property of a value that is not an object as undefined, `??` as null
only, a template's value as String() writes it.
