"""tools/fabric/control/secrets.py — the control agent's second ACTION:
re-sync this account's secrets from its own store (ADR-038; bin/fabric-secrets
sync), so a change the coordinator made to the login's store — which Claude
account it runs on (`fabric-accounts assign`, ADR-031) — reaches the account
without anyone logging in to it. The port of runtime/control/secrets.mjs
(ADR-040 Wave 8); the reply is frozen with the wire.

An action, signed, for the same reason `upgrade` is: it changes what the
account's next session runs on. What it applies is whatever the login's own
store says, opened with the login's own key; the request only says what to
expect and whether to act on it now:

  expect   the fingerprint the coordinator's template holds. The synced
           token must match it, or the sync is a failure: a move the
           account did not take is said by the account, not assumed.
  restart  a running session not already on the token — read from its own
           environment, not from the record; a broker session holds none by
           design and is left alone — is stopped (SIGTERM, never harder) and
           its launcher resumes it on the new sign-in: the upgrade's restart
           marker, written already done, so nothing is left to wait for. A
           restart asked for and not done is a failed reply. The requester's
           own session is never stopped (it is waiting for the reply).
           Without it a running session keeps the sign-in it started with,
           and the reply says it needs a relaunch. A session on the gateway
           is never stopped: its token file was replaced by the sync, and the
           reply says whether the gateway's own log confirms the switch
           (control/gateway_switch.py), also beside sessions that need a relaunch.

So a move is messages end to end: `fabric-accounts assign` writes the
reference, and every account applies, verifies and restarts by itself. What
comes back names the sign-in by fingerprint, never by value.

The upgrade's restart machinery (the marker, the session list, the guard
against two restarts) is control/upgrade.py's, python-dev-03's; it is
reached through `upgrade()` so this module imports without it.
