"""tools/fabric/control/sessions.py — what this account's sessions are doing,
told to the state channel when it changes (ADR-029 rule 16):
ported from runtime/control/sessions.mjs (ADR-040 Wave 8; deleted in
step s8), with j5's rule for a session state that cannot be read.

The harness hook runtime/claude-code/hooks/session-state.py keeps
<state>/session-state.json: per session id, working, blocked or idle,
since when, and the session's `claude` process with its start time.
agentd reads it every STATE_POLL_MS and posts a `state` record on the
state channel when what it would say differs from what it last said,
and again every STATE_HEARTBEAT_MS, so a listener that starts late, or
missed a record while the relay was down, converges without asking.

A session whose process is gone is left out: a kill or a crash never
sends SessionEnd, and an entry that outlived its process would read as
a session forever idle. The start time tells a reused pid from the
session's own. An entry that records no process (the hook ran outside a
harness) is believed only within NO_PROCESS_FRESH_MS of its `since`, and
said once when it is left out: kept for good it would read as a live
session forever, and tools/fabric/resume.py, which counts sessions this
way, would refuse every activation of the account. The hook's file is
never rewritten here; the hook owns it.

What leaves the account is the session id, its state and since when,
and for a session that has them its `reason` (permission or question, blocked only), `context` (an integer
percentage with its sample time) and `activity` (recent or quiet), never the transcript's path,
the binding's role and project, its last session's id with whether its
transcript is here (resumable), and `waits_on`, the GZCoord message ids
this login's blocked jobs wait on (ADR-037 rule 8): no path, no process
id, no title, no job id.

AN UNREADABLE SESSION STATE (j5; fabric-coordinator INFO 01a11e4e, the
owner 2026-10-09; python-dev-02's contract, INFO 01a11e4c and
01a11e4e-f664): the rule both watchers keep since af4cf645. read_sessions answers [] when
the file is absent (none), and None — unknown — when it is there but
cannot be read, parsed, or is not {"sessions": {...}}, as resume.py's
live_sessions reads it. While it is unknown the watcher says so on the
wire: the record's `sessions` is the string "unreadable" where it is
always a list, which a list-only reader drops (so a Node ctl, and any
reader not yet upgraded, keeps the last good record and reads it unknown
at STATES_STALE_MS), and ctl's own reader (control/ctl.py state_record_of,
state_row) shows the account's state unknown with why "the account cannot
read its session state", never a wrong "no sessions". It logs once when
the file goes unreadable and once when it reads again. (Before af4cf645
Node's sessions.mjs read both as [] and posted it; between af4cf645 and the
Node's deletion the watcher posted nothing while unknown.) Bytes that are
not UTF-8 make the state file, or the job list, unreadable on both sides.
Saying "unreadable" on the wire is new wire behaviour: it waited for the
Node's deletion (ADR-040 §7; fabric-coordinator REPLY 01a11ec9-b9e8,
2026-10-09), which #170 did, and is this change (job j68).

WHAT IS NOT NODE'S, beyond that: `since` is read as ECMAScript's own
date-time format (Date.parse's ISO form: a date, a time with its offset
or Z, a time without one in local time); the other strings V8's
Date.parse also guesses at are not a time here, so an entry with no
process and such a `since` is not believed — the direction that leaves
a session out. The state file's path is the caller's: Node's default was
upgrade.mjs's stateDir(), which is another port's.
