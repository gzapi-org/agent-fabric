"""tools/fabric/fleet.py — the fleet's data on demand (Fleet Deck, Stage 1):
one record per placed agent, assembled from what the control plane already
answers, when a view asks, never in the background.

    fetch(sections, agent=None, max_age=None) -> dict      the library
    bin/fabric-fleet --json [--agent L] [--section a,b] [--max-age S] [--days N]

CONTRACT
  stdout    UTF-8; a lone surrogate in a record's text is U+FFFD. One JSON object: {"schema": 1, "at", "sections": [names read],
            "agents": [{"login", "host", "address", "kind", "sections":
            {name: record}}], plus one top-level record per fleet section
            asked (FLEET SECTIONS); "cache" appears only when the cache could
            not be used, with why. A record is {"status": "ok", "src", "at",
            "data"}, {"status": "failed", "src", "at", "why"} or a stale one
            (STALE): `src` says
            where the value was read (proc-local, hostexec, op:<name>,
            pr-gate), `at` when. The granularity is the section record, not
            each number in `data`.
  Every placed agent has a record for every agent section asked (and the
  document one for every fleet section, below): a source that
  failed, answered without the agent, or timed out is a failed record with
  its cause, never a crash and never an absent agent.
  stderr    one `fabric-fleet: ` line on a refusal.
  exit      0 an answer was printed (failed records included: they are the
            answer); 2 usage, an unknown agent, an unreadable registry.

STALE  A section whose fresh read failed for an agent, whose last good value
  is no older than its class's stale window, is not "failed": it is
  {"status": "stale", "src", "at" (when the value was read), "age_s", "why"
  (the fresh read's failure), "data" (the last good value)}. Past the window
  the record is failed, as before; a failure is still never cached, and a
  failed refresh leaves the last good entry where it was. A slow account
  reads as old, not unknown.

TIMEOUTS  each cost class has its own bound on the program that reads it:
  `ctl` is fabric-ctl's wait for the control agents' replies, `call` the
  bound over the whole program (its relay reads can stall past the wait).
  class  ctl  call  stale window
  C0       8    40       60 s
  C1      20    60      600 s
  C2      30   120     1800 s
  C3      60   180     7200 s

FLEET SECTIONS  `plans` and `prs_unplaced` are about the fleet, not an agent:
  each is one record, {status, src, at, data|why} (stale as above), under
  its own name at the top of the document and in no agent's "sections".
  plans.data = {login, plans: [{id, title, status, created_at, steps: [{id,
  title, owner, depends_on, job, state, reason, started, finished,
  times_why, est_days}]}]}: the plans of the login that runs this (the
  coordinator's files; another login has none), steps in the plan's order,
  `state` what fabric-plan says (planned, waiting, unknown, or the job's),
  `started` the first time the job was active and `finished` the last time
  it was done, dropped or delivered, from the job's log as the owner's full
  list gives it through the executor (null where it never was; null with
  `times_why` where the list could not be read: unknown, not "never").
  prs_unplaced.data = {prs: [...rows of prs...], fetch_ok, prs_ok, base,
  gate_ok}: the PRs whose owner is no placed account. Asking for `prs`
  adds it; `plans` is named only. "sections" lists every name read: an
  agent section is a key of each agent's "sections", a fleet one a key of
  the document.
  prs rows (per agent and unplaced): pr, number, repo (<org>/<name> of this
  checkout's origin; the other projects' repositories are not read), branch,
  ahead, last_commit, paths_total from pr-gate --in-flight, and fabric-pr
  gate --json's own title, head, work_commits, fix_commits, checks, review,
  unresolved_threads, armed, queue_position, draft, verdict; the gate fields
  are null with `gate_ok` false and `gate_why` when the gate could not be
  read; `gate_found` says whether the PR was at the gate (null when the gate
  was not read). The in-flight row and the gate row of a PR join by number,
  or by branch where the listing had no number (a number the gate lacks is
  a PR not at the gate: gate_found false). closed_jobs.data adds done_total (state done only) to closed_total.

ATTENTION  `attention` (Fleet Deck's "needs you" views) is told from the `states` and `jobs` records of the same
  fetch, which a fetch that names it reads and shows too (like prs_unplaced with prs). It has no source of its
  own and no cache entry: it is as fresh as its inputs. data = {level, reason, since, blocked, pending}:
    level    needs_input  the account's most-wanting session waits on a PERSON (session-state's `blocked`:
                          a permission prompt, an input or elicitation dialog); wins over waiting
             waiting      an open job is blocked, on something that is not a person
             none         neither (no session, or only working and idle ones; no blocked job)
    reason   null for needs_input (the hook records that a session is blocked, not why; a later step),
             else the most recently updated blocked job's `blocked_on`: the agent's own words as a line,
             control characters and white space collapsed, cut at 80 characters, content NOT scrubbed
             (it can name a path): a view shows it as text only
    since    needs_input: that session's `since`; waiting: that job's `updated`; else null; null too where unknown
    blocked, pending  the numbers of open jobs in state blocked and queued
  `at` is the oldest of the two inputs' read times. Stale when an input is (data from the last good values,
  `age_s` the oldest, `why` both); failed, never level `none`, when an input failed, when the account's state
  is `unknown` (no fresh state record), or when the jobs answer is not a list. A human login has no control
  agent (ADR-044): its attention is failed with that why. Agreed with the views' author (rust-ui-dev-01).
  Not here, for want of a source on the control plane: context_pct, output activity, needs_input's reason.

SECTIONS, by cost class (the TTL is how long a cached answer is reused)
  C0 proc 5 s · states 5 s · presence 10 s
  C1 jobs 30 s · usage 60 s · host 60 s · fabric 60 s · attention (derived: no TTL, no cache of its own)
  C2 prs 120 s · prs_unplaced 120 s · plans 120 s · closed_jobs 300 s · accounts 120 s
  C3 tokens 600 s · disk 600 s     only when named: they walk disks/logs
  A section's `sources` are tried in order and the first that answers wins;
  Stage 2's control-plane ops replace a source here without changing the
  record's shape. `closed_jobs` is a Stage 1 bridge: the jobs files read
  on each host through the executor, read-only, until an op serves them.

CACHE  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/fabric-fleet/<section>.json (tokens-<days>.json: the
  window is part of the question), 0600 in a 0700
  directory, replaced atomically; a fresh entry is reused across processes.
  Entries are per agent, so `--agent L` never makes the rest look fresh.
  Only successes are cached: a failure is asked again, since a cached
  failure would outlive its cause. Two processes refreshing one section at
  once both write whole files and the later one wins; the loser's entries
  are re-read next time. No XDG_RUNTIME_DIR means no cache, not /tmp.

SIDE EFFECT  `prs` and `prs_unplaced` (a default section, riding with prs)
  run pr-gate --in-flight, which does `git fetch --prune origin` in this
  checkout, and `fabric-pr gate --all --json`, which reads GitHub for every
  open PR, on each call that has no fresh cached record for every agent
  asked (so always with --max-age 0 or without a cache); once per fetch for
  both sections.

NEVER read: /proc/*/environ, cmdline, transcripts (fleet_proc.py).
