"""tools/fabric/github/arm.py — arm auto-merge on a pull request with the
gates the managed projects put before the arming applied by the tool, not
by memory (ADR-019's count rule; `fabric-pr arm` runs it). Ported from
the first managed project's tools/gh/arm.sh, whose test is the oracle
(ADR-040 §5 rules 3–5); what was that project's own — the security-boundary paths and the classes that
arm under the floor without asking — is now the project's arm.json.

CONTRACT, frozen from the bash (ADR-040 §5 rule 3), its argv amended
since (agent-fabric #92): a boundary is waived only on the waiver role
holder's message, so --no-boundary alone — the bash's form — is now a
usage error, on a PR with no boundary file too, where a waiver of
nothing wrote a false record.

            the project's arm.json / the relay / fabric-ctl could not
            answer, the read-back is idle, closed or on another head,
            or usage

THE WAIVER:
the security-boundary gate is waived only on a message from the holder
of the project's waiver role, read from the relay and checked here, never
on the caller's say-so. Read only when a boundary matched: on a PR that
matched none the waiver is said, not read, and not recorded. It is
refused (exit 1) unless ALL of —
  - the replay says it is addressed to this session, and its TO is this
    session's own <host>/<login>: a BROADCAST or a TO-ROLE is not a
    waiver given to this session;
  - its type is DECISION or REPLY;
  - the relay's sender is a <host>/<login>, its FROM says the same, and
    it is not this session's own login (no self-waiver);
  - it carries the metadata line the approver writes on purpose,
        WAIVES: <owner>/<repo>#<n>@<head sha, 8 or more hex>
    naming this repository (case-insensitive), this PR, and a prefix of
    its CURRENT head — a message that only mentions the PR, a decline
    included, waives nothing, and an approval of one head arms no other;
  - fabric-ctl's presence of that login, on that host, reports the
    role arm.json's `waiver_role` names — the fabric's record of the
    login's binding, never the message's ROLE line.
Unanswerable (exit 2, nothing posted): the replay not giving its JSON
(relay down, no such message, a refused token), a waiver with no
MESSAGE-ID, fabric-ctl not answering for the login, and an arm.json
whose waiver_role is missing while a waiver is asked, or is not a role
of identities/roles/catalog.json. The arming comment records "Boundary
gate waived by <login> (<message-id>): <why>". A boundary that is NOT
waived still needs the review of the head and no open thread, and,
under 8 work commits, the owner's word.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE: the relay does not authenticate a sender
(BRIDGE-RELAY-SETUP.md) — FROM and the relay's sender are both the
poster's claim. The check stops a mistake (the wrong message, the wrong
PR, a decline, a stale head, a role not held), not a forger: a session
able to forge a waiver can run gh pr merge itself. A signed waiver is a
protocol question, not this tool's.

THE PROJECT'S RULES, projects/<id>/integration/gh/arm.json, found from
this clone's remote as trial.json is (or AGENT_FABRIC_ARM_CONFIG):
  boundary.paths    a regular expression, matched CASE-INSENSITIVELY
                    against each changed file: the project's
                    security-boundary list in path form. Over-matching
                    costs a review; under-matching costs a boundary.
  boundary.exempt   a regular expression for the files dropped BEFORE
                    the pattern is applied (documentation, tooling — a
                    wording PR on a privacy ADR says "regime" in its
                    filename: a managed project's PR #886, re-review
                    finding 1).
  boundary.cases    paths that must stay boundary: a case the patterns
                    miss is exit 2, never a judgement (lint also refuses
                    one dropped without boundary.retired's why and word).
  classes           {"<class>": "<regex every changed file must match>"}:
                    the classes the project lets arm under the floor
                    without the owner's word, stated in the PR body as
                    "Class: <class>". None is a project that has none.
  waiver_role       the catalogue slug whose holder may waive the
                    boundary gate: [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*, and a role of
                    identities/roles/catalog.json. Optional; a waiver
                    asked of a project without one, or with one that is
                    not a catalogue role, is exit 2.
  direct            optional: {"roles": [...], "pr_paths": "<regex>",
                    "cases": [...]}. A holder of one of `roles` pushes
                    straight to the project's default branch, unless a
                    file the pushed commits change matches `pr_paths`
                    (case-insensitive) or has the executable mode (100755),
                    and unless the push rewrites the branch (it must
                    fast-forward): those still come by pull request.
                    `cases` are paths that must need a PR; lint refuses
                    one pr_paths misses. Optional `not_cases` are the
                    opposite floor, paths that must go direct (a design
                    token, a key visual, a decision record); lint refuses
                    one pr_paths matches. fabric-pr arm IGNORES this key
                    (a direct push has no PR to arm); policies/githooks/
                    pre-push enforces it (agent-fabric ADR-019 §5 rule 1).
A project with no arm.json is exit 2: a boundary the tool cannot read is
never judged absent.

HELP = """Arm auto-merge on a PR — with the gates the project puts before the
arming applied by the tool, not by memory.

  fabric-pr arm <pr-number> --basis "<one line>" [options]

What it refuses, in order, and why:
  1. a PR that is not OPEN, or is a draft;
  2. another session's PR — the head branch's <host>/<login> prefix
     is not this session's (the lane rule: never arm, retarget or
     merge a PR you did not open; --any-owner overrides, for the
     owner's own hand);
  3. a body that names an AWAITING-SUPPLY with no range line for that
     login — supply asked for and not folded (fabric-pr owed-supply lists
     these; the caller arms never with its own REQUEST unanswered);
  4. a SECURITY-BOUNDARY change without the REVIEW CLASS'S review of
     the CURRENT head, or with an unresolved review thread, at any
     count (its owner's word is the count rule's, gate 5). Read from fabric-pr review-status --json: a
     `blind.rows` entry whose commit_sha8 is the head, and
     `unresolved_threads` 0 ("no open P1 or P2"); a missing field or a
     null count is exit 2, never a pass. Its exit status is NOT the
     gate: exit 0 means ANY counted review, an empty thread-reply review
     included. The boundary is read from the changed files against the
     project's patterns (projects/<id>/integration/gh/arm.json in
     agent-fabric). --boundary forces the gate on. --no-boundary
     <reason> --waiver <message-id|seq> waives it, on a message from the
     holder of the project's waiver role (arm.json "waiver_role") that
     the relay holds: a DECISION or REPLY sent TO this login (not a
     broadcast, not a role), from another login, carrying the line
         WAIVES: <owner>/<repo>#<n>@<head sha, 8+ hex>
     for this repository, this PR and its CURRENT head, from a sender
     fabric-ctl presence reports holding the role — never the message's
     ROLE line. Any of those not so is refused; a relay or fabric-ctl
     that cannot answer, or a message with no MESSAGE-ID, is exit 2.
     The relay does not authenticate senders: this stops mistakes, not
     a forger. The comment records who waived it, the message
     and the reason. A PR that matches no boundary ignores a waiver;
  5. the count rule (fabric-pr gate's classifier): 8 or more arms at the
     review gate; over 16 is ADVICE for the next batch, never a refusal; under
     8 is armed on the owner's word — the --basis must carry the phrase
     "owner's word" — EXCEPT a class the project's arm.json lets arm at
     the gate (none, in a project that declares none), STATED in the PR body
     ("Class: <class>") and confirmed by the changed files; a stated
     class the files contradict is refused, not trusted. A
     security-boundary change under 8 needs the owner's word whatever
     class it states; at 8 or more it needs none, boundary or not. A waived boundary is judged as no boundary.

Then: posts the arming basis as a comment ("Arming basis: <text> —
<W> work commits, head <sha>"; a security boundary armed at 8 or more
without the owner's word adds a sentence saying so), runs `gh pr merge <n> --merge --auto
--match-head-commit <head>` — pinned to the head the gates read —
and prints the watcher line to run — it is not started here, because
a watcher must be the SESSION's child for its exit to be the
session's callback.

Options:
  --basis "<text>"      required: the one-line arming basis
  --boundary            treat as a security-boundary change regardless of paths
  --no-boundary "<why>" waive the boundary gate, with --waiver; the reason goes in the comment
  --waiver <id|seq>     the waiver role holder's message (MESSAGE-ID or relay seq)
  --any-owner           arm a PR whose branch is not this session's
  --dry-run             evaluate every gate, arm nothing, post nothing

Exit codes:
  0  armed (or, with --dry-run, would arm)
  1  refused — the reason is the last line
  2  gh / pr-gate / pr-review-status / arm.json / the relay / fabric-ctl
