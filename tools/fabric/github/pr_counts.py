"""tools/fabric/github/pr_counts.py — fabric-pr counts: one pasteable line per
pull request, across repositories.

    fabric-pr counts <ref>… [--json] [--timeout S]

A ref is `167` (a pull request of this checkout's repository), `myproject#1075`
(a project id, or the name of a project's repository, from
projects/registry.json) or `owner/repo#N`; a leading `#` is allowed. One line
per ref, in the order given:

    #167 (9 work, 2 fix) open, armed, checks pending, head reviewed
    myproject#1075 (4 work, 3 fix) open, unarmed, checks red, review not on head
    #164 (1 work, 4 fix) merged

The first token is what the Stop hook (runtime/claude-code/hooks/pr-counts.py)
asks a reply to state, so a reply can paste it. The counts are `fabric-pr
gate`'s: the commits of the pull request, classified by commit_class (the
Kind:/Answers: trailers, merges told by their parents) and netted by their
reverts by pr_split.split_rows, the function the gate's own split runs. They
are read from GitHub's commit list, one GraphQL query per repository (ten
pull requests at most per query; a query GitHub refuses is asked again one
pull request at a time), not from a clone, so any registered repository can
be asked. Open, merged and closed-unmerged pull requests are all counted.

WHAT THE LINE DOES NOT SAY. `head reviewed` means a review object carrying the
review class's marker (the current one, the built-in earlier one, and the
project's legacy_review_markers from its pr-tools.json) is posted on the head;
`fabric-pr review-status`, which also counts a configured reviewer's verdict,
is the gate's reading and costs several calls a pull request. `checks` is the
head's rollup state (green, red, pending, none yet). A pull request over 100
commits is read through the REST list (up to GitHub's 250); beyond that it is
`cannot be read`.

Exit: 0 every ref was read; 2 a ref could not be read (its line names why) or
the usage is wrong. A line for a ref that could not be read is
`<ref> cannot be read: <why>`; never a traceback. Stdout is the lines (--json:
one object per ref); every `fabric-pr counts: ` message is on stderr.

For the hook: `count_lines(refs, timeout)` returns the lines;
`count_rows(refs, timeout)` the rows they are made from (`ok`, `line`, `work`,
`fix`, `state`, ...).
