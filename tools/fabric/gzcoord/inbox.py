"""tools/fabric/gzcoord/inbox.py — GZCoord's inbox: what the relay holds for
THIS session, delivered the way SPEC §17 says a recipient receives — a
body read only when it is addressed to it. Ported from
communication/gzcoord/scripts/inbox.mjs (agent-fabric ADR-040 §7, Wave
7); that path is now a shim that runs this.

CONTRACT, frozen from the Node:
  argv      (none)              drain: one cursor page, return at once
            --follow            the watch: block for the life of the
                                session, print each delivery as it lands,
                                never return on a quiet spell
            --until-delivery    the watch a session arms as a background
                                command (Bash run_in_background, 2 h
                                cap): block silently through quiet spells
                                and other people's traffic, print the
                                first delivery addressed here exactly as
                                --follow would, and exit 0 so the harness
                                wakes the session once per delivery; the
                                session reads it and runs this again. A
                                held inbox is waited out as in --follow.
                                Whatever ends it other than a delivery
                                or the harness's timeout is an exit
                                other than 0 with its reason on STDOUT (a
                                background command's output reaches the
                                session only at exit): 3 not configured
                                or no token, 4 a refused token, 5 a relay
                                unreachable for 15 minutes, 6 a delivery
                                the journal cannot keep, 7 an internal
                                error. The session runs it again only
                                after exit 0 or its own timeout.
            --wait [S]          block up to S seconds (Number(S), else
                                1800) and return the moment a message
                                addressed here lands; --keyword K
                                (repeatable, 3+ characters, at most 8)

            --replay <seq|message-id> [--json]
                                re-read ONE message; the cursor does not
                                move; a body not addressed here is not
                                shown. --json: one object (addressed,
                                seq, sender, when, type, metadata, text),
                                or {"addressed": false, "seq": N}
            --history [<seq>]   one line per message addressed here in the
                                relay's recent history; bodies stay with
                                --replay; the cursor does not move
            --held              is this account's inbox held (planning)?

            project's integration), CLAUDE_BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN (after the

            GZCOORD_TEST_BUS_ANY=1, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, HOME,
            GZCOORD_DEFAULT_LOCALE_ONLY
  stdout    deliveries (below one, a `queued as jN: <title>` line for each
            REQUEST to this login it put on the job list, intake.py), the
            drain's listing, replay/history output, the
            keyword hit, the watch's relay-down/back lines, the
            journal's held-messages line and, under GZCOORD_JOURNAL=off,
            one bypass warning per page. --follow runs under a Monitor,
            which turns each line into a notification as it is printed, so
            its relay-down/back lines are stdout. --until-delivery runs
            under a background Bash, whose output reaches the session once,
            at exit: it prints the one delivery (or, on exit 3-7, the
            reason; under GZCOORD_JOURNAL=off also the bypass warning)
            and no relay-down/back lines; the journal's held-messages
            line is printed only as it exits 6.
  stderr    every start-up and refusal line (under --until-delivery, the
            refusals that end it go to stdout instead); the hold's
            held/released
  exit      0 drained, delivered, nothing for you, relay unreachable on a
            drain or wait, and (outside --until-delivery) not configured
            or no token; 1 a usage line, replay of no such message, the
            --held "not held"; 2 a control channel named, replay not
            addressed (--json too); 3 a keyword hit, and under
            --until-delivery not configured or no token; 4 a refused
            token; 5 --until-delivery's relay unreachable for 15 minutes;
            6 --until-delivery's delivery held by the journal; 7
            --until-delivery's last resort. Anything unforeseen is
            `gzcoord inbox: <why>`, exit 0 for every mode but
            --until-delivery (7): the whole contract of a session start is
            one line and exit 0.

The rest of the Node's header — the modes, the hold, the addressee rule —
is kept where each applies: below, or in the part that holds it
(inbox_parts/). A watch is one consumer per address, run once per session
(under a Monitor for --follow, a background Bash for --until-delivery).
Never blocks a session start: relay down, no token, no catalogue — each is
one line on stderr and exit 0.

THE JOURNAL (ADR-041 rule 4), in this process now: a page's messages
addressed to this session are kept in its own journal before the page is
acknowledged; one the journal cannot take is neither acknowledged nor
shown. The Node ran episodic.py as a process per page, and that crossing
is where the journal's edge cases kept appearing (#78, #84, #88) — the
reason Wave 7 moved this file. The order is the protocol's and is kept.
GZCOORD_JOURNAL=off skips the journal, never the record: each of those
messages gets a line in journal-bypass.jsonl (gzcoord/bypass.py) before it
is shown or acknowledged, and a line that cannot be written holds the page
as a journal that cannot keep it does. --replay and --history leave no
bypass line, journal on or off: they show what the relay already holds and
acknowledge nothing, and the journal is not written by them in either mode.
A replay ahead of the drain shows a record no line or row records yet: it
is logged when the drain or the watch delivers it.
