"""tools/fabric/gzcoord/intake.py — a REQUEST addressed to a login is work
that login has, so it is on that login's job list without anyone
remembering to put it there (agent-fabric ADR-037 §7, the owner,
2026-10-09).

Two halves, both best effort — a REQUEST that cannot be queued is a line
on stderr, never a failed delivery or a failed post:

  receiver  queue_received(): the inbox, for each REQUEST it delivers whose
            TO is this login's own address, adds a queued job to this
            login's list through jobs.py: source the REQUEST (MESSAGE-ID,
            sender, seq), project its PROJECT, title "<SUBJECT> (REQUEST
            <MESSAGE-ID>)". A project with no working copy here is still
            the job's project (what jobs-add does); the job then carries no
            working copy. A message already on the list — a job with that
            MESSAGE-ID as its source, or "(REQUEST <MESSAGE-ID>)" in its
            title — adds nothing, so a redelivery and a second watch are
            one job.
  sender    queue_for_addressee(): gzcoord-send, once a REQUEST TO a login
            is posted, when the sender is the operator of the addressee's
            host (runtime/hosts/registry.json), asks the control plane's
            jobs-add for the same job under the same title — unless the
            addressee's list already shows it (a live watch is usually
            first) or the relay answered "deduplicated" (a resend). This
            reaches a session whose watch has lapsed at its next start. The
            id is in the title because jobs-add takes nothing else (control
            plane frozen, ADR-040 §7), and it is the only thing the two
            halves share: the check and the add are not atomic, so two
            near-simultaneous halves can still make two jobs; a person
            drops one.

Not TO-ROLE, not BROADCAST, not any other type: only an assignment names
one login (SPEC §13), and only an assignment is work."""
