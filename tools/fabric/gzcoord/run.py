"""tools/fabric/gzcoord/run.py <gzmsg|send|inbox> [argv…] — the routing the
entries share, under the pinned Python (`fabric-python -I`, which puts no
script directory on sys.path: this file puts tools/fabric there itself).
bin/gzcoord-inbox, bin/gzcoord-send and bin/gzmsg reach it through
entry.py, in their own process. Each tool's own contract is its module's
header; this file only routes, and ties the child's life to a shim when
GZCOORD_SHIM_PID names one. The Node shims that set it
(communication/gzcoord/scripts/*.mjs) were deleted with the Node control
plane (ADR-040 Wave 8, step s8); the tie stays for a caller that still
spawns this file with the variable set, and is the next thing to remove.

A Node shim stayed alive for as long as the tool runs — the session-start
hook finds the watch by `inbox.mjs --follow` in the process table — so the
tool must not outlive it: a shim killed outright (SIGKILL, which it cannot
forward) would leave a watch running that nothing sees and a second one
started beside it. The shim names itself in GZCOORD_SHIM_PID; on Linux the
kernel ends this process when the shim's ends (PR_SET_PDEATHSIG), and a
shim that is already gone when this starts is an orphaned start, and
nothing runs. Without GZCOORD_SHIM_PID — every start through bin/ — there
is no parent to watch, and nothing is tied."""
