"""tools/fabric/gzcoord/send.py — send ONE message over the relay. Ported
from communication/gzcoord/scripts/send.mjs (agent-fabric ADR-040 §7,
Wave 7); that path is now a shim that runs this.

CONTRACT, frozen from the Node:
  argv      <file> | -   [--dry-run] [--force]   the first argument not
            starting with `--` is the file (`-` is stdin); other flags are
            ignored, as they were
  env       what inbox reads (integration, token, AGENT_FABRIC_ROOT,
            AGENT_FABRIC_STATE_DIR), GZCOORD_JOURNAL=off,
            AGENT_FABRIC_FALLBACK_DIR and CLAUDE_PID (the fallback
            reminder), AGENT_FABRIC_JOBS_AUTO_INTAKE=1 (off unless exactly
            1), GZCOORD_PRESENCE_WAIT_MS (the presence CLI's),
            AGENT_FABRIC_HOSTS_REGISTRY / AGENT_FABRIC_OPERATOR (the hosts
            registry a REQUEST's job intake reads)
  stdout    `sent seq <n> <TYPE> <id>` and nothing else
  stderr    everything else: the id minted, warnings, refusals, presence,
            the journal's own lines, fabric-jobs's own lines, and for a
            REQUEST to a login (intake.py) one line: `queued as jN on
            <address>'s job list`, or why it was not
  exit      0 sent (a dry run: validated and resolved); 1 usage or
            unreadable input, or the id could not be written into the
            file; 2 invalid, FROM not this login, an id already sent with
            other text, a control channel, a journal that cannot keep
            the message, or (GZCOORD_JOURNAL=off) a bypass that cannot
            be recorded; 3 not configured, no token, relay unreachable,
            the token refused, or a post whose outcome is unknown (it may
            have been delivered); 4 an addressee with no session, silent, not
            placed, or presence not askable — unless --force

After a REQUEST TO a login is posted by that login's host operator, the
send may run fabric-ctl (up to two calls, 30 s each) to put the job on the
addressee's list (intake.py); a failure there is a stderr line and never
changes the exit status.

The message is normalized (a pasted body carries terminal indentation),
validated as the last step before it leaves (SPEC §1) — a message that
fails is not sent — and refused when its FROM is not this session's own
address: the sender is the login, and a message claiming another one
would be misattributed on every recipient's cursor.

A message with no MESSAGE-ID gets one here, written into the file before
anything else happens, so sending the same file again — a retry after an
unknown outcome — carries the same id and every reader discards the copy
(SPEC §7.2). Minting by hand and substituting a placeholder put a command
on the owner's screen that showed something other than what was sent
(2026-09-26). A present id is kept; a placeholder is refused. From stdin
there is no file to keep it in, and that is said; a dry run mints in
memory only.

An id travels with its file, so a scratch file reused for the NEXT message
would carry the last one's id (review of #47, R1). Each confirmed send is
recorded — id and a hash of the message — in this login's state directory
(<state>/agents/<login>/gzcoord-sent.jsonl), and an id that already went
out with other content is refused; the same message again passes. A post
whose reply was lost is not recorded, so an edited resend under that id is
not caught.

PRESENCE, and why it is the control plane's process, not a copy here: a
TO or TO-ROLE message asks whether its addressee has a session before it
leaves. That question goes over the control channel, whose request and
reply shapes are the control plane's (tools/fabric/control/presence.py;
the Node it was kept in by ADR-040 §7 is deleted, Wave 8 s8); a copy here
would be a second implementation of them to keep in step. So this runs
`python3 tools/fabric/control/presence.py check` (the coordinator's
decision, 2026-10-04): one implementation, changed once. It runs only for
an addressed send, beside a wait of up to six seconds. A timeout, an
interpreter that cannot run or an answer that cannot be read is
"unavailable" — never present.

THE JOURNAL (ADR-041), in this process: kept before the carrier sees it,
its outcome after, once it is known (accepted, or failed when the relay
provably does not hold it; otherwise the row stays pending, "may have
reached the carrier"); a journal that cannot take it refuses the send — a
carrier may keep no copy, so a message sent unremembered could be gone
for good. GZCOORD_JOURNAL=off sends without it and says so every time:
first a "pending" line in journal-bypass.jsonl (gzcoord/bypass.py), and
a bypass that cannot be recorded is refused, exit 2; then, once the post
is over, an "accepted", "failed" or "unknown" line (said, never a
refusal, when it cannot be written).
The order is the protocol's and is kept.
