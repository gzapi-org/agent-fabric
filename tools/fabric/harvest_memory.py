"""tools/fabric/harvest_memory.py

Drain THIS AGENT's Claude memory into a claims directory the assembler
can consume.

    tools/fabric/harvest_memory.py --role architect-cto --out /tmp/drain
    tools/fabric/assemble.py --claims /tmp/drain/claims --drain /tmp/drain \\
        --project <project> --stamp $(date +%F)

    tools/fabric/harvest_memory.py --role architect-cto --bundle - > drain.tar
    tools/fabric/assemble.py --bundle drain.tar --project <project> --stamp $(date +%F)

THE BUNDLE. `--bundle FILE|-` writes the same drain as one tar — claims/,
observations.jsonl, references.json, harvest-report.json — plus a
manifest.json naming who harvested (agent, host, role, project, working
copy label, the watermark window) and the sha256 of every file. It is
the artifact that crosses a host: `bin/fabric-host <host> drain <login>`
runs this AS THE ACCOUNT on its host and streams the tar to the
coordinator, who assembles it (assemble.py --bundle verifies the
manifest first). Only the agent reads its memory; the coordinator
receives the result (review, 2026-09-16).

PROVENANCE. Every observation is stamped with the AGENT (the Linux login,
from runtime/identity.py), the HOST, the PROJECT the working copy belongs
to (projects/registry.json, by remote) and the WORKING COPY's basename as a
label. The agent is never derived from the directory; the directory only
says where the memory was written (`--working-copy`, default: cwd), which
is how Claude Code names the memory directory being drained.

The role payload lands in `<out>/claims/`, one directory below the drain
metadata, because assemble.py reads EVERY .json under `--claims` as a
role payload and would take `references.json` for one.

WHY MEMORY AND NOT TRANSCRIPTS. Earlier drains read a session-memory
plugin's store and, later, raw transcripts; both are retired. Claude's
own memory is a better input than either: a memory file is ONE fact,
written deliberately
at the moment it was learned, carrying a `why` and a `how to apply`. That
is already the shape a claim wants, so this needs no model pass, no
transcript scraping, and no redaction layer -- the input is curated text
rather than raw session bytes.

SCOPE IS PER AGENT, BY DESIGN. Each agent distils its own memories into
the shared corpus; nothing here reads another account's home directory.
The role the claims land under is given explicitly (`--role`), defaulting
to the agent's active role binding.

ROLE KNOWLEDGE IS OPT-IN. A memory reaches this corpus only if it says so,
by carrying `roles_class` in its `metadata:` block:

    metadata:
      type: feedback
      roles_class: workflow

Nothing is inferred from `type`. That was the first design here and it was
wrong in three ways at once: it needed a mapping table, a special case to
drop `user` memories, and a refusal for unrecognised types -- three
mechanisms answering one question, "does this belong in the shared repo?".
Worse, `type` cannot answer it. Memory has four types and `.roles/` has
nine classes, and `project` alone covers both live threads and durable
constraints; measured on this account's first five memories the mapping
mis-filed two of three. Asking `type` to carry that decision made the
memory author hold two taxonomies in their head and still guess.

So the memory answers directly, or it is not drained. A memory with no
`roles_class` is SKIPPED AND NAMED in the report -- an omission you can
see beats a wrong filing you cannot, and for a shared corpus that is the
right way round.

`charter` and `recall` are refused as targets. lint.py exempts exactly
those two from `derived_from`, which is what marks them hand-authored; a
derived claim must not enter through that door.
