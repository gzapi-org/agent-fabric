"""tools/fabric/launch.py — launch this agent's Claude Code session through
OpenRouter (or plain claude), with the capability classes resolved from
agent-fabric's routing files (ADR-040 Wave 4; runtime/openrouter/launch is
its shim, and every caller — the README, moveto, fabric-fresh, the restart
below — keeps that path).

    runtime/openrouter/launch [claude args...]     # resolve, export, exec (broker)
    runtime/openrouter/launch --provider anthropic # the same, on plain claude
    runtime/openrouter/launch --provider gateway   # plain claude's routing, through the gateway
    runtime/openrouter/launch --print              # resolve and print; no exec

CONTRACT, frozen from the bash (ADR-040 §5 rule 3):
  argv      --print, anywhere: resolve and print, never start a session.
            --provider <p> | --provider=<p>, anywhere, p in openrouter
            (the default) | anthropic | gateway; any other value: exit 1.
            gateway routes as anthropic does (the same pins and agent
            files) and reaches the models through the gateway: see
            launcher/gateway.py, which starts it, hands the harness its
            loopback URL and a local key and no upstream credential, and
            stops it when the session ends. Both are
            the launcher's and are removed; every other argument passes
            through to claude in order, after the refusals below. There is
            no help text: --help and --version pass through to claude. A
            --help (or -h) before any `--` installs no agent files: a help
            read rewrote the account's for the launcher's default provider
            and the dispatch guard then refused reviews (2026-10-02).
  stdin     never read; the session inherits it.

  files     reads the settings scopes, ~/.config/agent-fabric/secrets.env,
            the agent's state directory (binding.json,
            model-profile.local.json, restart.json); writes
            $STATE_DIR/launch-prompt.md (launch_prompt.py),
            ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME}/.claude.json (onboarding, plain
            claude and the gateway path, which also approves the local key
            there; none for --help), the agent files (install-agent-files.sh; none
            for --help), $STATE_DIR/launch-provider.json after they are
            installed (the provider, for a later install with none, and the
            `transport` when it is the gateway), on the gateway path
            $STATE_DIR/gateway-plan.json, gateway.json (pid, version,
            listener, plan digest; removed at the end) and gateway.log, and
            creates /var/tmp/agent-fabric-<agent>. Fast-forwards the fabric
            checkout and the launch working copy when they are behind.
  stdout    --print's report, byte for byte the bash's (compared for every
            role and both providers on the Wave 4 branch); otherwise
            nothing of the launcher's own.
  stderr    one `launch: …` line (or a few indented ones) per refusal,
            warning or notice; a module this file loads that crashes adds
            its traceback, as the bash's heredocs did.
  exit      0 after --print; 1 for every refusal; otherwise the session's
            own status, 128+n when a signal ended it; 127 when the shim
            finds no pinned interpreter. A relaunch (after a pull, an
            upgrade, a fresh job) re-executes the shim and its status is
            that run's.

Deliberate differences from the bash, each where it could only print a
traceback or hang: a settings file that is JSON but not an object is
skipped with one line instead of a traceback (it was never refused); an
unreadable ~/.claude.json is one line before the refusal; every subprocess
is bounded (ori auth 60 s, the harness's --version 30 s, the agent-file
install 300 s; a fetch was already 20 s), and a bound that is hit reads as
that call's failure, ori's as exit 124; every git call is bounded too, at
git.py's 120 s, the fabric's `pull --ff-only` included (a pull the bound
ends is said as a timeout, never as "cannot fast-forward"), and so are
the helpers (identity, routing, launch_prompt, jobs) at HELPER_TIMEOUT_S; a
closed stdout (`--print | head`) ends quietly with 141, as bash's SIGPIPE
did. The helper processes run on this interpreter (the fleet's pin),
where the bash ran whichever python3 PATH named. The session inherits
descriptors 0-2 only (close_fds): the bash passed it every descriptor
its caller left open, while a leaked pipe end would hold the caller's
pipeline open for the session's life. One caller hands one on, to this
process and never further: bin/fabric-resume's flock on
<state>/resume.lock, inherited through its exec, which this launcher
holds for its own life — its restart wait and the sessions it relaunches
through the shim keep the same descriptor — so that no second activation
starts while it runs (tools/fabric/resume.py). The harness never gets
it, so a background child of a session cannot keep it past the launcher.
Every other caller holds none (fabric-lease closes its lock's before the
command; moveto's shell, the control agent and fabric-fresh hold none). AGENT_FABRIC_RESTART_WAIT_S that
is not a number is said in one line before the resume is given up, where
the bash printed a traceback.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Launching is a decision no session can make for itself:
one launch decides the provider for EVERYTHING under it, subagents
included. Neither modelOverrides nor repo settings can do this:
modelOverrides is taken as the WHOLE MAP from the highest precedence
scope that sets it (so any scope both paths share binds both paths),
while ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL are OVERRIDABLE process env — the
launcher exports them, `ori claude` carries them to every agent.

WHAT IT RESOLVES (tools/fabric/routing.py is the one implementation):
  capability class -> model     routing/capabilities.json (the provider's column)
                                <- routing/profiles.json defaults
                                <- roles.<role>        (the agent's binding)
                                <- agents.<login>      (the agent itself)
                                <- $STATE_DIR/model-profile.local.json (gitignored;
                                   bin/fabric-model writes it)
  model -> family shim          routing/shims.json
  class -> harness alias        runtime/claude-code/aliases.json
Every layer is per provider (providers.openrouter / providers.anthropic)
and speaks the CLASS — code-low, code-medium, code-high, code-plan,
code-review — and the provider's model id; the tier alias a class
rides is the adapter's (aliases.json), never a user's word. Each coding
class is exported as ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_<ALIAS>_MODEL for the tier it
rides: on the broker <model@shim>, on plain claude the native pin (the
column's top-of-tier, or a layer's). The composite string exists only
here, in the child's environment.
Every class rides an alias: the Agent tool's `model` field accepts
only the tier aliases, so a "declared full id" in an agent file can
never be named by a dispatch (verified live 2026-09-13 — the reviewer
fell through to the opus alias and ran on GLM). The review class
rides `fable` with code-plan, and one alias carries one export, so it
is never exported: its model is written into the reviewer's agent file
for this launch's provider (install-agent-files.sh, below) and the
dispatch guard drops the dispatch's alias so the file decides. The
review gate guards that model.

WHO IS LAUNCHING. The agent is the Linux login (runtime/identity.py);
the role comes from that agent's runtime binding, written from a login
shell by bin/fabric-role (tools/fabric/role.py) — never from inside a
session. The launch DIRECTORY decides which settings scopes are fenced
and which working copy the child starts in; it never decides who the
agent is.

THE ROLE RIDES IN THE SYSTEM PROMPT. tools/fabric/launch_prompt.py
renders, for the bound role, the identity header, the charter, the
brief and the shared team/memory sections into $STATE_DIR/launch-
prompt.md, and every exec below passes it as --append-system-prompt-file
(read back live on both paths, print and interactive:
docs/live-checks/2026-09-15-append-system-prompt.md). The session holds
its role from its first request, through every compaction, and cannot
edit it; the old /role command asked the model to Read a charter after
the fact. The project layer (the remit, the INDEX) is NOT in that file —
it follows the cwd and reaches the session from the SessionStart hook.
The role, and the prompt's sha256, are stamped into the child's
environment (AGENT_FABRIC_LAUNCH_ROLE, _PROMPT_DIGEST) so fabric-status
can say what this session was launched as and see a rebind under it.
The launcher announces nothing: whether a session is running is the
control plane's to answer, from the process table (runtime/control/
presence.mjs, docs/adr/ADR-030-presence-replaces-hello-and-goodbye.md) — HELLO/GOODBYE are retired.

The merged REVIEW model MUST be in routing/policies/review-grade.json:
a review's failure mode is a green PR that merges, so the reviewer's
model is never a cost cut. Lint enforces this on the committed files;
the launcher enforces it again on the MERGED result, because the local
override layer is where a cheap-reviewer experiment would sneak in.
The coding classes are not gated.

REFUSES, fail-closed, before spawning anything:
  - no runtime binding for this agent      -> "fabric-role bind first"
  - pass-through args carrying --system-prompt, --system-prompt-file,
    --append-system-prompt or --append-system-prompt-file: the role's
    prompt is the launcher's, and claude refuses two of them anyway
  - routing/capabilities.json missing
  - merged review model not review-grade
  - pass-through args carrying --settings or --setting-sources
    (ori's own provider fence uses --settings; a caller's one would
    override it and the session could silently leave OpenRouter). On anthropic
    and gateway --settings is allowed, and refused when it carries a model pin
    (the same test as every settings scope)
  - any settings scope (the managed-policy file, ~/.claude/settings.json,
    ~/.claude/settings.local.json, $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json, the
    launch working copy's and $PWD's .claude/settings{,.local}.json)
    carrying a model pin — env.ANTHROPIC_*, env.CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL,
    modelOverrides — or an EFFORT pin: effortLevel, maxEffortLevel,
    modelSettings, env.CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL; or
    CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL or CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL (set to
    anything, the empty string included) in the caller's environment
    (a settings-scope pin outranks the profile's exports; the subagent
    variable overrides every dispatch's model, and the effort variable
    outranks every agent file's effort: in every subagent at once)
  - a merged model that is not a model id (a local override of null, a
    number, "" or prose)
  - ori not authenticated, or authenticated from anything but the
    environment (`ori auth --json`: authenticated AND source.kind ==
    environment, exit 0)

NEVER: CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE. It discards every dispatch's
own model and forces the parent's; capability classes would stop
meaning anything.

CREDENTIAL: an OpenRouter API key per agent account, as
OPENROUTER_API_KEY in ~/.config/agent-fabric/secrets.env, which
`fabric-secrets sync` writes from the account's own store
(runtime/provisioning/README.md, "Secrets"; ADR-038) and no shell
sources: the launcher reads it and hands it to ori alone, and drops every
other synced secret from the session (settle_secrets) — never in the repo.

The environment is handled as the bash's shell environment was: this
process's os.environ IS what the session and every helper inherit, set and
cleared in the bash's order, so a helper sees exactly what it saw there.

# sections and routing of the checkout it was launched from. "Pull, then
# relaunch" was the rule, and moveto pulls on entry — but an account
# that keeps its moveto shell open for a day relaunches from it without
# a pull, and on 2026-09-16 two accounts came back on the previous
# launcher (no GOODBYE, two HELLOs) after a DECISION told everyone to
# pull. So the launcher checks: a fetch, and a checkout behind
# origin/main is PULLED — fast-forward only; every role but the
# coordinator is read-only here, so there is nothing local to lose, and
# --ff-only refuses on its own if the checkout ever diverged — and the
# launcher re-executes itself so the session runs on what was pulled
# (the code under a running launcher must not change).
# It was a refusal naming the pull command until the CEO asked, the same

# that cannot fast-forward is refused with the reason; offline (the fetch
# fails) it launches on what is checked out and says so.
