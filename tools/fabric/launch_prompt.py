runtime/openrouter/launch calls this just before exec and passes the file
to claude as `--append-system-prompt-file` (read back live on both launch
paths: docs/live-checks/2026-09-15-append-system-prompt.md). The session
therefore holds its role from its first request, in the system prompt —
which survives compaction and cannot be edited from inside — instead of
being asked to Read a charter after it starts (the old /role command).

WHO IS NOT A PARAMETER. Agent, host and role are resolved here, from the
OS and the runtime binding (runtime/identity.py); the caller names only
where the file goes. Nothing about identity can be passed in.

WHAT GOES IN, in order: the identity header; the role's charter; its brief
(how the role works, in any project — absent until written, and a missing
brief never blocks a launch); then the two sections every role shares,
identities/prompt/team.md and memory.md, with `{role}` substituted.

WHAT STAYS OUT: the project. The remit, the INDEX pointer and the working
copy follow the cwd and change with `cd`; they reach the session from the
SessionStart hook (runtime/claude-code/hooks/session-start.py), never
from this file. The filesystem is context, not identity.

BYTE-STABLE by construction: no timestamps, no session id, no cwd. The
same (agent, host, role) renders the same bytes, so the harness's prompt
prefix stays cacheable across relaunches and the digest the launcher
stamps (AGENT_FABRIC_LAUNCH_PROMPT_DIGEST) changes only when the content
did.
