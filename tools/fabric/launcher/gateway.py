"""tools/fabric/launcher/gateway.py — the gateway path: `--provider gateway`.
A part of tools/fabric/launch.py, whose docstring is the contract.

The harness talks to the gateway on a loopback port, holding only a
gateway-local key; the gateway holds the upstream credential (the account's
token file, re-read on every attempt) and routes by the plan the generator
(tools/fabric/gateway_plan.py) writes. So `fabric-accounts assign` takes effect
on the next request, with no session restart. The contract with the gateway is
its control-plane-contract.md §11, §12, §14, §15 and the plan-v0 README
(runtime_contract 1).

THE ORDER, each step refusing before the next: the installed gateway's
`--version --json` names a runtime_contract and plan schemas this launcher
supports; the plan is written and its bytes digested; `serve --plan P
--local-key-fd K --ready-fd R --control-fd C` is started with the key on K
(written before the start, so no read can wait on it), a pipe for R and the
gateway's end of a socket pair for C (the launcher keeps the other end: holding
it is the authority to activate a later plan; this launch never does); the
READY record is read, and must name a contract and plan schema supported, a
loopback listener and the digest of the plan written; only then does the harness
start, with ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL the listener, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY the local key, and
every upstream credential removed from its environment (control-plane-contract.md
§11, "Controller obligation": a harness that bypasses its base URL has nothing to
present upstream). The gateway stops when the session ends.

PROCESS LIFETIME (§15): the gateway is a child in a session of its own, so the
terminal's Ctrl-C, which the harness takes as "interrupt this turn", does not end
it. It dies with this launcher: PR_SET_PDEATHSIG (SIGTERM) set in the child before
exec, with a check, in the same step, that the parent is still the process this
launcher recorded before the fork — closing the one window the gateway cannot (a
launcher that dies after the fork and before the gateway's first instruction).
The signal is tied to the thread that forks, so the fork is made from the main
thread, which lives as long as the launcher.

The local key is 256 random bits, in the gateway's descriptor and the harness's
environment and nowhere else: not argv, not a file, not the state record.
