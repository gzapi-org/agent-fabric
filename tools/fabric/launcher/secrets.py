# a process whose requests go to a third party (review of #33). Dropped

# Which Claude account a plain-claude session runs on is the login's synced
# record, not the shell this launcher inherited: a shell opened before
# `fabric-accounts assign` moved the login still holds the old token (or
# none), and a relaunch from it — including the upgrade's automatic resume
# — would start on the old account (2026-09-25, devex-tooling). Read from
# ~/.config/agent-fabric/secrets.env at every launch; absent there, an
# inherited one is dropped. Said by name when it replaces or drops one.
