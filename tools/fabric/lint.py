Guard the committed corpus the way the contract validators guard the
wire surface.

    tools/fabric/lint.py                 # lints this agent-fabric checkout
    tools/fabric/lint.py --fabric PATH

The corpus is written by tools and read by sessions, so the failures
worth catching are the quiet ones: an index that no longer matches the
slices it points at, a slice that grew past what a session can afford to
load, provenance that points at nothing, or content that should never
have been committed at all.

Checks:
  schemas    the role catalogue, every project taxonomy, the routing
             profiles and every slice's frontmatter validate
  identity   every role directory is catalogued; charter, brief and recall
             are the only authored classes; payload is well-shaped
  index      every (project, role) index lists every slice the role has —
             its domain slices, its project slices, its charter and recall,
             its shared slices — and every index line resolves
  budgets    no slice exceeds its token budget
  shared     a shared slice really is shared (two or more owners)
  profiles   every review-grade gate in routing/profiles.json holds, and
             every role row names a catalogued role
  hygiene    no person's name (people by role: the CEO, the owner, an
             agent by its login — policies/hygiene.json), no city or
             country names, no external project names (each project's
             .agent-fabric/hygiene.json), no credentials, no non-English
             prose
  prompt     the launch-prompt sections (identities/prompt/) exist, carry
             the {role} placeholder, are hygiene-clean and within budget

Exit 0 clean, 1 on findings, 2 on usage error. Uses jsonschema when it is
importable and falls back to a built-in structural check otherwise, so a
clean machine can still run it.
