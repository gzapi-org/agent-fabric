"""tools/fabric/memory_use.py — what the fabric-memory server wrote in a login's state, read for a drain (ADR-049).

The server (tools/fabric/memory_mcp/) appends two files to agents/<login>/: memory-marks.jsonl (a session's verdict on
a section: time, id, verdict, note) and memory-calls.jsonl (one line per call: time, tool, hit count, the ids returned,
and for a read whether the last find returned one of them). Agents live on different hosts and the coordinator never
reads another account's state, so the harvest (harvest_memory.py) carries both in the bundle: the marks themselves, and
counts over the calls. Query text is never in either file and never here.

CONTRACT
  read(state_dir, since_ms)  rows whose time is after since_ms (a ms epoch, the store's watermark; 0 reads all):
      marks   [{"t", "id", "verdict", "note"}], file order; a row that is not a mark of the server's shape is dropped
              and counted
      use     {"since_ms", "until_ms", "calls": {tool: n}, "zero_hit_finds", "finds_followed_by_read",
               "ids_read": {id: n}, "marks": n, "unreadable_lines", "notes_withheld"}
      until_ms the latest row time read (>= since_ms): the watermark covers these rows like memories
  A missing file is no rows, not an error; an unreadable one is the same, said in `unreadable_lines`.
  A note that carries a credential by shape (the caller's screen) is withheld, the mark kept."""
