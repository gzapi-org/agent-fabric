"""tools/fabric/new_agent_worker.py — the decisions of new-agent's host
half (ADR-040 Wave 5). runtime/provisioning/new-agent-worker.sh stays a
bash step-runner (ADR-040 rule 1: sudo, useradd and the vendors'
installers); what it must decide — its arguments, the claude version, the
subordinate id range, the GitHub host keys an account lacks, the closing
list — it asks this module, by the fleet's pinned interpreter's fixed
path (the worker runs as a host's operator, with sudo: an interpreter the
environment chose could be anything). Standard library only, nothing
imported from the fabric: tests/test_new_agent_cli.py runs it in a fixture fabric.

    new_agent_worker.py args <worker argv…>        the worker's variables, as bash to eval
    new_agent_worker.py host-check <login>         hostname -s, then whether the account exists
    new_agent_worker.py audit <platform> <persists> <hint> <n-tools> [<package>…]
    new_agent_worker.py claude-want <root> [<target>]
    new_agent_worker.py subids <login> <etc>       "have <start>:<count>" or "alloc <start>-<end>"
    new_agent_worker.py missing-keys <keys-file>   known_hosts on stdin; the lines it lacks
    new_agent_worker.py verify <root> <login> <home> <sudo> [<project>…]   step 10 and the closing list

CONTRACT of the worker, frozen from the bash (ADR-040 §5 rule 3), parsed
here: `prepare|finish <login> <role> [--claude V] [--clone <id>=<remote>]…
[--project <id>]… [--dry-run]` or `host-check <login>`; a missing phase:
USAGE, exit 2; an unknown argument, no login, no role: one line, exit 2;
--claude without a value: exit 1. Exactly as the bash shifted: a phase
with too few words keeps them, so `prepare <login>` reports the login as
an unknown argument, not "no role" (replicated, not fixed).
Every message here is the worker's own (`new-agent: …`, or
`new-agent-worker: …` for its usage), on stderr.
