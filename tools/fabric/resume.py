"""tools/fabric/resume.py — bring this account's last session back, behind
bin/fabric-resume.

    fabric-resume [--print] [-- <launcher args>...]

Run in the account's own shell (after `moveto <account> --resume`, or by a
person), never inside a session. It reads the account's binding (the
session id the session-start hook last recorded), finds that session's
transcript under ~/.claude/projects/, and runs the fabric's launcher with
`--resume <id>` in the directory the session ran in (the transcript's own
`cwd`), so the harness finds it. With no binding session, no transcript or
no directory left, it starts a fresh session in the binding's working copy
and says so: a resume that cannot happen is a fresh start said, never a
failure (architect-cto's plan for Fleet Deck, 2026-10-07; the upgrade
path's relaunch made first-class).

NEVER A SECOND SESSION (docs/fleet-deck/tab-states.md, "What must hold
whatever the deck does"). It refuses to start any session, resumed or
fresh, while another one could be running on the account:
  - it first takes <state>/resume.lock: flock, exclusive, non-blocking, on
    a descriptor it opens itself and marks inheritable just before it
    execs the launcher, which therefore holds it for its own life — its
    restart wait and every session it relaunches — and never hands it to
    the harness (the launcher's Popen keeps close_fds). The kernel drops it
    when the launcher exits; there is no pid file to go stale. The pid is
    written into the file once the lock is taken, and is the launcher's
    too, since an exec keeps it. Held: refused, naming that pid, or
    "pid not yet written" in the moment between the two;
  - then the account's own session state, <state>/session-state.json, as
    tools/fabric/control/sessions.py counts it: an entry in a known state
    whose recorded process is alive with its recorded start time, or that
    records no process and entered its state within NO_PROCESS_FRESH_S
    (two heartbeats, 20 min); one older than that is a probe's (a real
    session always has its claude ancestor), which nothing removes, so it
    is not counted, and said, naming it. Any such session,
    not only the binding's: the binding names the last session started,
    and one from another terminal may be older. A file that exists and
    cannot be read is refused too, never read as "no session".
The lock closes the window the check alone leaves: a session enters the
state only once it has started, so two activations seconds apart would
both pass it. A person who runs the launcher by hand bypasses both.

--print says what it would do, one line, and runs nothing; with --print,
its own or one passed to the launcher after --, no lock is taken: the lock
is read from /proc/locks, and a refusal is said as a real run says it.
Exit codes: the launcher's when it runs; 2 inside a session or for a bad
argument; 3 refused (a lock held, a session alive, its state unreadable),
said in one `fabric-resume: refused: …` line on stderr; 1 when the lock
cannot be taken for any other reason.

It chooses resume or fresh, where, and the provider: the one the
account last launched on (launch-provider.json), unless the arguments name
one; for an account that never launched, routing/profiles.json's
launch_provider for it, its role or the defaults. The launcher's own default is a fixed provider, not the account's, so
a resume without it would come back on another provider's models and bill.
Model, effort and prompt stay the launcher's.
