"""tools/fabric/routing.py — capability -> model -> family shim.

Two independent dimensions, one derived artifact:

    CAPABILITY CLASS -> CONCRETE MODEL       routing/capabilities.json (+ profile layers)
    MODEL FAMILY     -> COMPATIBILITY SHIM   routing/shims.json
    model @ shim                             derived here, at runtime, never committed

    routing.py resolve code-high                      # openrouter by default
    routing.py resolve code-high --provider anthropic
    routing.py table [--provider P]
    routing.py check                                  # validate the canonical files
    routing.py shim <model>                           # the family shim a bare model id needs, if any

    routing.py pins [--provider P] [--me]             # the file-pinned classes (the review class): <class> <alias> <model>

Profile layers (routing/profiles.json and the agent's local override) may
override a class's model and name the session's; the shim is looked up on
the MERGED model, so an override to another family gets that family's
shim, or none.

A LAYER IS PER PROVIDER. The two launch paths speak different vocabularies
(an OpenRouter id on the broker; a tier alias or a native `claude-…` id on
plain claude), so a layer names each provider's choices under
`providers.<provider>.{session, capabilities}`. The flat `session` and
`capabilities` a layer may also carry are the OpenRouter form — and a flat
`session` of `anthropic/<id>` serves plain claude too, as `<id>`. The
merge is per provider, per key, nearest layer wins:
defaults <- roles.<role> <- agents.<login> <- the agent's local override
($STATE_DIR/model-profile.local.json, written by bin/fabric-model).
