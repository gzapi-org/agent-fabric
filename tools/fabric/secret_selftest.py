"""tools/fabric/secret_selftest.py — the own-secrets self-test, behind
`fabric-secrets selftest [--json]`; run as the account by its control agent
for the signed `secrets-selftest` action (tools/fabric/control/selftest.py).

The real commands, as an agent would run them, each a subprocess:
    precondition  the store answers `store names --json`, and the fixed name
                  is an own name (secretstore/reserved.py) the store does
                  not hold: an agent's own entry by that name is never
                  overwritten or removed — the test refuses to start
    set           `fabric-secrets store set NAME`, a canary made here
                  (secrets.token_urlsafe) on its stdin
    run           `fabric-secret-run NAME -- <python> -I -c <probe>`, the
                  probe given the canary's SHA-256 on its stdin and
                  answering only whether its environment's value matches
    rm            `fabric-secrets store rm NAME`, run whenever set ran,
                  whatever happened between
    absent        `store names --json` no longer lists it, and
                  fabric-secret-run refuses it (exit 2)
A LEFTOVER (the own-secrets review, R3; the coordinator's rule D,
2026-10-07). A set whose push failed keeps its commit, and an rm whose
fetch then fails refuses: the canary stays committed in the account's
store. The run says so and fails, and records the commit it left in
<store>/.git/agent-fabric-selftest-leftover. The next run removes it first,
by the normal rm, only while that commit is still the last one touching the
name, is "agent <this login>: set NAME" and is signed by this store's own
key; anything else by that name is the agent's own entry and refused. A
write still starts from its remote, and no history is rewritten.
So a pass leaves the store as it was found, with two signed commits more
(set and rm). The report names each step, ok or not, and why — never the
canary or its digest, which live only in this process and the probe's
stdin. A reason is fixed text and an exit code, never a command's
output: a command whose stdin was the canary could echo it, and a scrub of
what it printed is a sanitizer nobody can check (#108, CodeQL 48 and 49). Exit 0 pass, 1 fail; the JSON is {"status": "pass"|"fail",
"name": NAME, "steps": [{"step", "ok", "reason"}]}."""
