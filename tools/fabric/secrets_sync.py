                                         the store holds none. A login without
                                         that directory, or a sandbox HOME, is
                                         skipped, said, and sync still succeeds.

It applies whatever the store holds, and refuses when the store's
AGENT_LOGIN is not this login — location and configuration never decide
who an agent is, the login does. The names it REQUIRES are the login's
kind's (runtime/hosts/registry.json `kinds`, ADR-044): every name above
for an agent, only its identity and CLAUDE_BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN for a human
(HUMAN_NAMES); an agent's names in a human's store are `withheld` — never
applied, and status and sync fail on them.

The contract (ADR-038 §5 rule 7), frozen when this moved from the bash
heredoc and its Doppler reader retired: the exit codes — 0 applied, 1
unreadable, 2 applied with required names missing (or gh refusing
GH_TOKEN, the login's kind unreadable, or an agent's names withheld from a
human), 3 the store names another login and nothing is applied; the JSON report's `error` and
`missing`, which the control agent reads (tools/fabric/control/secrets.py);
the `--quiet` line on stderr, which moveto's shell entry shows. status
exits 0 or 1; its JSON lists `refused` and `no_trusted_base` per store
("store": "own" or the child's agent id; a base's "state" is "no base" or
"unreadable", as fabric-ctl keys names it).

An agent's own entries — a name the fabric does not reserve
(secretstore/reserved.py), which `fabric-secrets store set` took — are
reported as `own` (names; the text says "own: N") and written nowhere:
fabric-secret-run decrypts one for one command. `unexpected` is left for a
reserved name nothing applies.

Nothing here prints a secret value: names, presence, ages and modes only.
