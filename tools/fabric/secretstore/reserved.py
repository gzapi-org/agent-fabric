"""tools/fabric/secretstore/reserved.py — which entry names the fabric manages, and so which are an agent's own.
A part of secret_store.py; secrets_sync.py imports it too, so that the names
set and rm refuse and the names sync reports as "own" can never disagree.

A reserved name is one the fabric writes and applies: the names sync applies
(below), every per-agent name projects/registry.json declares (`agent_env`,
fabric-wide or per project), and every name under CLAUDE_ or FABRIC_. Every
other valid name is the agent's own: set, rm and fabric-secret-run take it,
and sync reports it by name only and writes it nowhere.

A registry that cannot be read is no answer: reserved() raises, and a caller
refuses rather than take a name it cannot classify (the coordinator's P2,
2026-10-07)."""
