"""tools/fabric/tools_install.py — install a tool a project declares as an
account tool, into this account's ~/.local/bin, from the release the
registry pins (behind `fabric-tools --install <tool>`).

A tool in projects/registry.json with `"where": "account"` may carry

    "install": {"version": "3.69.0", "url": "https://…/doppler_3.69.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz",
                "sha256": "<64 hex>", "member": "doppler"}

`version` is what the tool's `proof` must print; `url` an https release
asset; `sha256` the asset's digest, checked before a byte of it is
unpacked or placed; `member`, when the asset is a .tar.gz, the one file in
it that is the tool (absent: the asset is the tool). Nothing is fetched
unless the registry says what it must hash to, and nothing is piped to a
shell.

The verdict, one per run:
  current    the tool's proof already prints the pinned version
  installed  fetched, hash verified, proved from its temporary file, then
             moved into ~/.local/bin in one rename
  skipped    this account has no working copy of a project that declares
             the tool (the Doppler CLI stays off every other account: the
             owner, 2026-10-08) — nothing was looked up, fetched or written
  failed     the fetch, the hash, the unpacking or the proof said no;
             whatever was already installed is untouched
  refused    the request names no installable tool, a declaring project's
             pin cannot be acted on, or the projects that declare it
             disagree about the pin or the proof

Exit codes (fabric-tools): 0 current, installed or skipped; 1 failed;
2 refused or a bad argument.
