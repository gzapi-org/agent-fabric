"""bin/fabric-usage — the fleet's Claude usage windows, one line per placed
account, read by the coordinator through the host executor.

  fabric-usage                the fleet: every placement in runtime/hosts/registry.json
  fabric-usage <login>...     those accounts only
  fabric-usage --json         the same as JSON lines

Each account reads its OWN usage: the executor runs the read as that
login, in its home, and the account's OAuth token goes from its
credentials file into one request header and nowhere else — never to
a terminal, never to this output. What comes back is the utilisation
of the five-hour and seven-day windows, when each resets, and the
Claude account the login is signed into (email, from the harness's own
profile record, not a secret). A control-plane read: no message, no
session, no model in the loop (the CEO, 2026-09-17 — the first such
table was made by hand, and only the coordinator's login can make it).

An account with no credentials file, or whose read fails, gets one
line saying so; the table is never silently short. An account running
on a Claude-account template (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN in its synced
secrets.env) shows `(setup-token)` for its email: its own sign-in, if
any, is another account's, and the setup-token cannot read the usage
endpoint, so its windows are read from the headers of one one-token
inference reply, against that account's allowance — each run costs
such an account one call (docs/live-checks/2026-10-08-usage-from-inference-headers.md,
docs/adr/ADR-031-claude-accounts-assigned-applied-and-proved-by-signed-action.md).

Superseded for everyday use by `bin/fabric-ctl all usage`, which asks
each account's control agent over the relay (docs/adr/ADR-029-the-control-plane-a-control-agent-per-account.md):
no sudo, no per-host loop, a second instead of a minute. This stays as
the fallback for a host whose daemons are down.
"""
# The contract the port keeps (ADR-040 Wave 3, from bin/fabric-usage):
#   - argv: --json anywhere; -h/--help prints the docstring's first six
#     lines, exit 0, where it is met; any other `--…` is exit 2 there;
#     everything else is a login to keep.
#   - the rows in the registry's placement order; the header line in text
#     mode only; a status row (no-credentials, read-failed, unreadable,
#     executor-failed) for every account that has no numbers;
#     exit 0 once the table is out.
#   - the remote read is the shell text in READ, run as `sh -c` by the
#     executor as the account: it never leaves the account's own process,
#     and its token never reaches this one.
# Changed, and said in j31's delivery and on #114: a named login that no
# placement has, or that the registry's kinds call a human (ADR-044), is
# exit 2, the unplaced one naming the registry read (the bash left it
# out of the table, which then read as an answer); a registry that
# cannot be read as a placement map is exit 2 (the bash printed an empty table, which its
# own header promises never to do); jq is no longer needed on this host
# (the remote read still uses jq and curl, as before); an executor that
# has not answered within EXECUTOR_TIMEOUT_S is `executor-failed` (the
# bash waited for ever; the executor is killed, and what it started as
# the account ends at curl's own 20 s bound); an executor that exits
# non-zero is `executor-failed` whatever it printed (the bash read its
# last line as the account's numbers); AGENT_FABRIC_HOSTEXEC names
# another executor, as store_enroll.py reads it, for a test. On #114's
# review (fabric-coordinator REQUEST 01a11a18, item 2): a setup-token
# account is no longer the status `setup-token` but a reading, its JSON
# row carrying "via": "setup-token" and a null email, as control/ops/usage.py reads
# it for fabric-ctl.

# A login on a template runs on its setup-token, which the usage endpoint

# one-token inference reply, as tools/fabric/control/ops/usage.py reads them
# (docs/live-checks/2026-10-08-usage-from-inference-headers.md): the
# fraction as a percentage to a tenth, the epoch reset as UTC minutes. A
# reply of any status with a number in a window header is a reading (a
# full window answers 429), which is why curl has no -f; a reply with
# none, the headers absent or not numbers, is read-failed, as control/ops/usage.py
# reads it. The token is taken from
# secrets.env as fabric-secrets sync writes it, bare or single-quoted
# (shlex.quote of a token); secrets.env is never sourced, which would
