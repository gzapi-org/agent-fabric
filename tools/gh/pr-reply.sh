# Reply to ONE review thread and resolve it, in a single call.
#
# The body arrives on STDIN and is never interpolated into a command
# line. That is the point of this script, not a detail: replies quote
# code, and a body pasted into a double-quoted `gh api -f body="..."`
# gets `backticks` command-substituted and `$vars` expanded by the shell
# before gh ever sees it. That has already happened here — a reply
# posted with the name of the guard it was describing silently removed,
# because the shell ran it. Reading stdin into a variable and handing
# that variable to `gh -f` closes the whole class.
#
# It also enforces the two rules that are easy to break by hand:
#
#   * ANOTHER SESSION'S PR IS REFUSED. Ownership is the branch prefix,
#     not the PR author (every session pushes as the same GitHub user).
#     The repo-root CLAUDE.md is explicit: never answer reviews on
#     another session's branch. A wrong reply cannot be unsent, and that
#     session is mid-flight on a fix you cannot see.
#
#     A BRANCH THAT NAMES NO SESSION IS NOT "ANOTHER SESSION'S". The
#     guard used to take the first two segments of anything and compare
#     — so dependabot's `dependabot/pub`, a pre-convention `feat/x`, and
#     `add-claude-github-actions-178…` each read as a rival session, and
#     the refusal told you it was "mid-flight on a fix you cannot see"
#     about a session that does not exist. Nobody could answer those
#     threads through this script, and nobody owned them either: four
#     such PRs held seven unresolved P1/P2 findings for a month. The
#     shape is checked now, and an unowned PR is allowed with a warning
#     — the reply still needs the owning SURFACE's role to have verified
#     the claim, which is what the warning says.
#   * RESOLVING IS A CLAIM. --no-resolve exists for the case where the
#     reply is a question, or the finding is real and not yet fixed.
#     Resolution stopped gating merges on 2026-08-06, so a resolve now
#     signals only "handled" and nothing downstream catches a false one.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/gh/pr-reply.sh <thread-id> [options]   # body on stdin
#
#   tools/gh/pr-reply.sh PRRT_xxx <<'EOF'
#   Fixed in #123 — the guard now anchors the filter.
#   EOF
#
#   tools/gh/pr-reply.sh PRRT_xxx --no-resolve <<'EOF'
#   Real, but the fix needs the contract change first — leaving open.
#   EOF
#
# Options:
#   --no-resolve   post the reply, leave the thread open
#   --dry-run      show what would be posted, touch nothing
#   -h, --help     this text
#
# Thread ids come from the queue: `/comments`, or the GraphQL in the
# pr-review-backlog skill. They look like PRRT_kwDOS6OPLs6XAV3d.
#
# A quoted heredoc (<<'EOF') is the recommended way to pass the body:
# unquoted, the SHELL expands it before this script is reached, and no
# amount of care in here can undo that.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  replied (and resolved, unless --no-resolve)
#   2  invocation problem — bad id, empty body, not your PR, gh failure
