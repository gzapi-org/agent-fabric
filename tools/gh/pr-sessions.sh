# Which SESSION owns which PR, newest first.
#
# Every PR in this repo carries the same GitHub author, because every
# session pushes with the same credentials. `gh pr list` therefore shows
# one name against all of them and answers nothing about who is doing
# what. The session identity lives in the BRANCH NAME instead — the
# repo-root CLAUDE.md mandates
#
#     <hostname -s>/<clone-dir-basename>/<type>/<short-desc>
#
# so the first two segments are the session, and everything after is the
# work. This script reads that, and marks the rows belonging to THIS
# clone so "mine vs theirs" is visible at a glance — which is what the
# stay-in-your-own-lane rules turn on: never push to, rebase, delete or
# answer reviews on another session's branch.
#
# DEFAULT SCOPE: run inside a clone, and it shows THAT clone's PRs.
# Asking "which PRs are mine" from inside a working tree is the common
# case, and the clone you are standing in already answers it — so that
# is the default rather than something to remember a flag for. Pass
# /all to see every session.
#
# (There is no unscoped-outside-a-repo case to describe: `gh pr list`
# needs a repo context and fails first, so the script never gets that
# far. The empty-ME branch below is belt-and-braces for a future
# --repo flag, not a path you can reach today.)
#
# Usage:
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh                 # THIS clone's PRs (default)
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /all            # every session
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh -n 50           # last 50 rows
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /OPEN           # open PRs only
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /MERGED         # merged only  (/CLOSED too)
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh --session gzapp-claude3
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /all --by-session   # grouped, all sessions
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /lastItem:50    # pool = 50 most recent PRs
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /lastDate:2d    # pool = updated in the last 2 days
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /lastDate:6h /unresolved   # ...then filter
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /unresolved     # only PRs with an open thread
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh /all /unresolved # ...across every session
#
# State is chosen at FETCH time, so like /lastItem and /lastDate it
# narrows the pool before scope, /unresolved and -n ever see it.
#   tools/gh/pr-sessions.sh --no-threads    # skip the review-thread lookup
#
# /lastItem and /lastDate narrow the POOL, and are applied BEFORE
# everything else — session scope, /unresolved and -n all operate on
# what they leave behind. That is what separates them from -n: -n trims
# the printed page, these decide what was ever considered.
#
# The THR column counts UNRESOLVED review threads. These no longer gate
# a merge (required_review_thread_resolution went off 2026-08-06), which
# is precisely why the column matters: a PR can merge with findings
# outstanding, so this count is the only place they surface. A
# trailing "!" means the last word in at least one of them is NOT the
# PR author's, i.e. somebody is waiting on a reply. "2" without the
# bang means you answered and simply have not resolved the threads.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  listed (even if the result is empty)
#   2  invocation problem (no gh/jq, not authenticated, bad flag)
