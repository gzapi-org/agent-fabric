# Behavioural tests for pr-reply.sh.
#
# Three things this script promises, each of which is unrecoverable if
# it is wrong — a posted reply cannot be unsent:
#
#   1. the body reaches GitHub byte-for-byte, with no shell expansion
#      (the defect the script exists to remove: a reply lost the name of
#      the guard it described because a backtick was command-substituted
#      on its way through a double-quoted argument)
#   2. another session's PR is refused
#   3. a thread is never resolved unless the reply actually landed
#
# The mock `gh` records the exact argv it was handed, so assertion 1 is
# about what would have been transmitted rather than about what the
# script believed it sent.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions passed
#   1  one or more assertions failed
