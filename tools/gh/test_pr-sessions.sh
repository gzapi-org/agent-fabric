#
# Behavioural tests for pr-sessions.sh.
#
# The script shipped across five PRs (#393, #394, #396, #397, #398)
# with no automated coverage, and review found four defects that a test
# would have caught on the way in — the author comparison that always
# rendered "!", the `/unresolved` filter that reported "none" after a
# FAILED lookup, an argument parser that spun forever on a missing
# operand, and bot branches attributed to a session named after the
# bot. Everything here is driven through the real script with a mocked
# `gh` on PATH, so the assertions are about observable output, not
# internals.
#
# The mock is faithful where it matters: `gh api graphql --jq FILTER`
# applies FILTER with real jq to a fixture GraphQL response, so the
# aggregation the script actually depends on is exercised rather than
# stubbed past.
#
# Run from anywhere:
#   bash tools/gh/test_pr-sessions.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all assertions passed
#   1  one or more assertions failed
